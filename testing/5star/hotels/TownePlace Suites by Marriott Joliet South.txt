Sybil working the front desk on Sept 18 was amazing.  Kind, polite, cheerful and welcoming.   This woman is a shining example of perfect customer facing personality.  Next time I come back here she better be running this place or at the very least have a giant raise to show for her hard work and incredible efforts at flawless service.

Really felt like I wasn't in joliet with how nice this place was inside. Super clean and extremely friendly staff. Rooms were spacious with a lot to offer. Hidden gem in such a crumby city.

Wonderful room, delicious continental breakfast and free cigarette smoke coming through your bathroom fan! Keep your fan on and there is no problem. Great pool and hot tub too!

Room had a strange smell.  Front desk staff were very nice. Breakfast was more than enough. 

Cat friendly hotel.

We checked in Friday-Sunday, & from the time we checked in we received nothing short of Perfect Peace when entering this establishment. Everyone from the start of the check in, was very hospitable throughout the entire stay. Brenda, was a very personable guest services clerk, as well as the entire breakfast attendant staff. Definitely enjoyed myself and will be returning as soon as I come back into Chicago area. Excellent Stay.
