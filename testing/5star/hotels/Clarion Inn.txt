The man with the glasses at the hotel was watching me and my cousin wherever we went. We left to go get something to eat and we came back with only 2 friends, but our friends wasn’t going to stay with us they were just visiting us for a bit and the man with the glasses over did his part when we was walking to the elevator with them. He asked for our room number and then followed us when we got to our room. He had a problem with our friends being in the room so he told them they had to leave and he got into one of their faces and my friend was like “don’t step foot in this door” and the man was being very disrespectful to our friend so I told my friends just go so he won’t over his part more like he already was before.

The hotel and room was clean. The location was quiet and close enough to the freeway exit. The stay was pleasant.
I liked the comfortable room and immeneties in the room.
I would have liked a TV schedule, but other than that I had all the conveniences I needed.

This Clarion leaves a lot do be desired. It seems to be run on a shoe string budget. In the room I was provided one thin towel and one wash rag. The drinking cups were unsanitary styroform with no wrapper. There is no coffe maker in the room, very low quality mattress and bedding, cheap siap, shampoo is the little tear open packs, no continental breakfast. I wiuld never choose to stay in this hotel. My company makes me do to them winning a low bid....surprise!
