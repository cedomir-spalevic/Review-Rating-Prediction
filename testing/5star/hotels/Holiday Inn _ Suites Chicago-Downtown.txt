What a joke at the bar. This guy cares more about his friends then the customers. As a regular patron through my company this is a joke. Week drinks n no service unless your a personal friend.  Disappointed is to say the least.. Dwayne cares more about personal friends then customers, not like anyone cares. What's a joke. Bad language n customers are disregarded for friends.  Never had worse service from this hotel chain  period. Makes me rethink my loyalty.

Nice stay. Very friendly staff. Lots of attention paid to small comforts. I appreciate a hotel that goes above and beyond with the little toiletries in the bathroom! Haha. Comfy beds and pillows, nice furniture, bathroom was small but well appointed. Great location also.

Recently stayed for work. Checked in Sunday night departed Thursday morning. I noticed a bite on my arm. Didn't think much of it in the morning. By mid afternoon noticed several more bites. Currently have 12-15 bites on my arms, legs, feet and face. Anything that wasn't covered by clothing. I immediately contacted the hotel to let them know so they could check the room and treat it before any other guests had to deal with this. The front desk person was friendly and apologetic. I wasn't irrate or rude.  I was told the manager was unavailable and was in a meeting but would call me back immediately. I gave my name and number. 2+ hrs and counting still zero call. Bed bugs happen, I know that but I think how a hotel handles bed bugs says a lot about a hotel. I will note that the head board on the bed has a gap even though most hotel chains have gone away from this due to the fact it gives bugs a place to hide. I informed my managers as this is a hotel we frequently use for employee training classes as well as regular stays.

The receptionist made my experience bad. Everything else was great. We had already contacted the hotel beforehand for them to use an organization credit card, however when we got it the receptionist asked for our personal credit cards and charged us for our rooms. There needs to be more attention to detail specially since the hotel is located in a place where various colleges students stay when there are conferences.

This is the second time we've stayed at the Holiday Inn & Suites Chicago downtown. It's conveniently located near the center of downtown Chicago. The hotel is clean, the rooms are comfortable and the staff is friendly and helpful. They have a pool located on the top floor. The hotel has all the amenities you'd expect. They have a nice restaurant on the floor level that doubles as the room service kitchen. Parking is expensive, but there is a city lot next door as an option. Package deals for the room with parking included at a discount are available online. We had secured one of those packages, but we had to point out the discounted parking to the staff at check-in. They were pleasant and accommodating when we pointed that out. Over all, we have enjoyed staying here and look forward to returning on future visits.
