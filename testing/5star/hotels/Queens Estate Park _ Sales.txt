I loved my neighbors, mgt was not the best but I have heard they have been replaced and it's much better now. Street maintenance is not the greatest though.

Amazing how the only people with time to review are the troublemakers that were recently evicted. This place is great and the only known drug dealer was a guy named Jason who was recently evicted. What a coincidence!
I have family and friends who live there and they love it, nice playground and the roads are better than most streets in town. It's amazing how little my friends pay to live there.

The only thing that goes up is the lot rent.The tenants are bottom of the barell
Management is a joke,both are mental defectives.Pot holed streets,snow not plowed. This is the true example of trailer trash.
