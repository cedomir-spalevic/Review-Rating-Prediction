Had to switch rooms because they didnt have the cleaning done by check-in time. Room was clean, but pics look better than real life. Room was hot. There’s no temp control in room, you have to call front desk. Called front desk to see if they could turn temp down. They reluctantly said they would, but room felt more hot after a while. Husband woke up in the middle of the night overheated so he opened a window to cool down the room, but then couldn’t sleep because of the sounds from the busy street. Just pay the extra $50-$100 to stay somewhere nicer and up to date.

This hotel seems very old looking from the outside. When you go into your room, it is not the newest furniture, but, the bed is very comfortable, the desk and chair are comfortable to work at with a colleague working from the big comfy chair. It is in a very good location of a Chicago with lots of places to visit within walking distance. I would stay here again on my next business trip.

Quirky, inexpensive, clean and well situated. This is a good place to stay when you're more interested in the city than in hotel amenities. Kind staff, also.

First, it's a MOTEL (easy to forget) so expect motel confort. It's cheap, clean, relatively quiet, free parking and in the city center. A good deal for the price.
There's no breakfast but they have a coffee/tea machine and some basic fruits. We had a good stay.

DON'T STAY HERE!! CHECKED IN AND OUT IN UNDER AN HOUR. 
First of all we booked this place because a local Chicagoan recommended a booking website for us and this place had a retro style I liked, free parking, WiFi, and is in a great location. Upon arrival we were HORRIBLY disappointed. 
1) We arrived late in the evening and there was NO AVAILABLE PARKING in their lot. Plus, we had to sit akimbo in the parking lot for someone to come to the front desk because there was a "be back in 10 minutes" sign on the door. When we checked in and asked about parking, the employee directed us to park at the McDonald's overnight parking for $35 A NIGHT!! 

2) We got into the section where our room was and there was a STRANGE SMELL. It was annoying but tolerable. We weren't to off-put yet. 

3) The room was rough around the edges. My partner made the reservations and had high hopes, however, I thought it was to be expected. He was disappointed. I was DISGUSTED at the yellow liquid stains on the wall. 

4) Again, we had a long trip behind us and I needed to use the restroom. I broke the "Fresh. For your protection" seal on the toilet. The seat had brown spots on it, but that's not the worst part. The toilet was FULL of TOILET PAPER. Okay, so not happy at this point, but willing to flush it. Flush it AND THE TOILET IS CLOGGED. We call the front desk to rectify the situation and she proceeded to tell us to come get a plunger from the front desk and plunge the toilet ourselves. We were like "No, no, no, we did not do this, we broke the seal and it was clogged. The toilet is not clean for our standards." Her answer was, again, to come get a plunger and fix it ourselves because they aren't allowed in our room after we checked in. 

THAT WAS IT. 
We got the car from the McDonald's parking lot before the free hour ended and packed up our stuff and GOT OUT. 

We were able to find a MUCH BETTER hotel two blocks down AND FOR CHEAPER.
