The rooms are nice and full of accommodations. We're talking a fridge, a safe, the simplest a/c. Things have been real quiet especially considering that it's so close to the El railway. People are cool behind the desk. I saw someone withhold a star because the people at the check in desk didn't wave to them everytime they came and went. I get it, but the desk isn't that close to the elevator that it required that level of acknowledgement so frequently. The location is good. Its safe and has so many places to eat. It's also a small block or two away from the best and cheapest parking in the area. It's also close to many hotels like the wit, and some other places.

Spent five nights here while attending a conference. The property was very nice, with a modern, but slightly art deco vibe. Staff was friendly and helpful. AC and plumbing were new and worked great. There are no views from room windows.  EL train runs above Wabash Street in front of the hotel, but once inside the hotel you would not know it. This is Chicago.!! Good food just down the street in either direction.

This hotel is quite nice with a lot of space and two televisions. Great service at the front desk. I stayed here with my wife who had it for work.  I think they cater to corporate clients and search. Very nice bar but nobody there usually.

My review is for the bar/lounge on the ground floor; I was not a guest of the hotel. The ground floor is nice. The bar sits in the middle with the lounge surrounding it. There are TVs on the walls and the ambiance is very relaxing. The hotel sits right at the new Washington/Wabash station which is a good complement.

Loved my stay here. I've been away from home on business for weeks and this was my last stop before finally going home. Everything in this place is absolutely gorgeous. The staff is exquisite and beyond accommodating. I travel all the time and I cannot recall the last time I was so impressed with a hotel. Would recommend this place to anyone willing to listen! Thank you for an incredible stay!
