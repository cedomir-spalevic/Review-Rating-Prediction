I wish i could give this place a big fat "0", bad service and no blankets!!!!!! all we had on the bed was a top/bottom sheet. When asked about blanket or spread they said non was available. The breakfast was BAD! The  only hot food sausage and gravy looked like it was in the pot for a day or so. I paid $75 through priceline! RIP OFF! Express deal. 2 and half stars. beware.

Zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!Someone please burn this hotel down!!! Not familiar with the Chicago area and decided to find a hotel at reasonable price for the night around 99.00 a night!!  Baymont Hotel is the worse hotel ever and in a really bad neighborhood  so beware!!! First off the room was hot air condition broke , mattress had blood stains all over it, bathroom dirty, walls very dirty, sheets dirty. We tried three different rooms and all was horrible!!! They refused  to issue a refund due to no refund policy. The pictures  of the hotel was very misleading!!! My guest and I took a loss and left hours after booking the hotel. We didn't even unpack our clothes and relax  before we ran out of the place. My advice never check into a hotel like this without looking at the rooms first before u sign anything. Health department seriously need to shut this building down NOW!!!!

I wish I could give this place 0 Stars. Don't stay here. 

I've stayed at this location several times for work. Most the time it smells heavily of Marijuana. This last visit It took me 45 minutes to check in because I was assigned to the wrong room. Then because of this issue I was given a "random" room check phone call at 4am.

Never staying here again and no neither will anyone from my company. 

Please. . . Choose another.

Shoddy and dated paint job. Slow staff who didn't seem to knowledgeable at what they were doing. Customer service just really subpar. Not worth the prices they charge you. You're better off grabbing a cheaper deal with Motel 6 and getting much better quality

Biggest changes:  CANNOT USE COMPUTER PAST 10:00 P.M. and DINING ROOM & CONFERENCE ROOM OFF-LIMITS AFTER BREAKFAST FOR ENTIRE DAY & NIGHT SO NO SEATING AFTER HOURS EXCEPT COUCH AND LOVESEAT IN LOBBY AREA. ICE MACHINE UNPLUGGED BY LEAST 12:00 A.M.  Definitely NOT the Baymont experience one is accustomed to. More akin to a quick stopover destination. Facility needs minor repairs. Rooms need minor repairs such as a cracked sink bowl. Spider webs on ceiling corners and walls. Chipped paint and tiny holes in walls were pictures once hung years ago when owned by Caucasian management. Now owned & managed by FRIENDLY, adept India individuals. Decent housekeeping, plenty linen & towels upon request. LAUNDRY MACHINE BROKE DOWN. Poor plastic quality coffeemakers, ice buckets, etc. Definite change in customerbase:  More lower-income African-Americans and Caucausians.
