Would of been my third stay at the comfort inn, my previous 2 experiences were great. Upon entering and giving my drivers license as I usually do I was informed that I had to leave and not welcome to stay due to living locally. Checked everywhere on their website for this 'policy' but they didn't have it posted anywhere. If you live within a 30 mile radius stay clear they won't allow you to stay. Just glad I hadn't made a reservation prior to coming in.

I have stayed at this hotel many times before and had no problems. Now I go on line put my address in for reservations and received confirmation number from Comfort Hotel Bourbonnais IL. and upon checking in I am told that because we live with in 30 miles we can,t get a room and we will still be charged for the room. They also said that locals cause all the damages in their hotel. We have always left the room as we got it upon arrival and leave money for the maid when checking out. If you ever experience any hardships with your home (fire, flood or any emergency.) this hotel is not within our village of friendship.

I've stayed here for years without flaw, definitely my preference locally until this evening. Tonight when I called to make a reservation I was informed that due to residing within 30 miles from the hotel I was no longer allowed to frequent this establishment. I'm not 100% sure why Comfort Inn is interested in alienating its local clientele but I can assure you that my family, friends or anyone I would refer a room to won't end up here.y family and I have been god customers here for along time and I'm not sure why this policy has been put into place.... 1 star for poor local service!

We stayed one night. The staff was friendly, hotel was quiet. The room was spacious. Even though we had the air conditioning on, it seemed humid in the room to the point that the carpet felt damp. Maybe there isn't much that can be done about that on a 90+ degree September day though. Overall, I would stay here again.

The hotel is very nice and the staff great. My only complaint (?) was that the room was oddly humid even with the AC running. Everything always felt slightly damp. It was odd.
