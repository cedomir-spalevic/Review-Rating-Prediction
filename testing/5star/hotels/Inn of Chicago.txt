It's a 3 star hotel so expect 3 star quality or lack there of.  Location is great though!   One staff member was really nice and upgraded us to at top floor suite which we were so grateful for.  But carpets are pretty dingy with spots all over.  That was the extent to our good customer service.  Everyone else was just okay.

3 day stay here at Inn of Chicago. Rooms are very much old but kept nice and tide. Staff doesnâ€™t seem to be friendly but the check in and check out was quick.
Amazing location in the Magnificent Mike and got access to many attractions in Chicago.
Good for money.

This place was super comfy.  I slept so well.  It was cozy and a bit small but really really clean and the staff was super nice.  If want to enjoy a hotel trip others may have more offer BUT if you are trying to enjoy the city this is an AMAZING spot.

I'll start by saying, the friendliest staff ever, plenty of clean towels and sheets,good location. However, the downstairs lobby is very deceiving. This place needs to be remodeled. Ugh sigh.....smallest, loudest and awful eye burning bright lights in the elevators, paints peeling everywhere, holes in walls, carpets disgusting and sticky, a/c never worked (why I'm writing this review!), sink leaked and was literally falling off the wall, bottom of tub was sticky (YUCK!), AND (second reason in writing this!) my boyfriend was disgusted. He couldn't even sit in the office chair provided. How do I put this? Because it honestly looked as though it had male squirts on it?!!!! He laid a towel across the bottom and backing just to sit and put his shoes on the first night. He begged me to get a different hotel room and I said they all were probably like that one. He was so grossed out! We love Chicago and again I say the staff is wonderful. 3 stars is me being kind to the staff. Just beware is all. If they bring the amenities up to the standards that match the staffs friendliness and professionalism then it will be a really cool place. Good luck.

To the supposed owner whom responded to my post. I state again the service from the staff is to be seen separately. The staff is wonderful. The place is in really bad shape. Start there first. No apologies needed. Just fix it and I'm sure your business will get better.

Rooms were a bit small, but they made good use of the space. The ac worked great, so the room was a welcome respite from the summer heat. The elevators were a bit small, but we never had to wait long to up or down from the 17th floor. Checked bag service was courteous and efficient. Great place to stay in a great location for a lot less than I'd expect.
