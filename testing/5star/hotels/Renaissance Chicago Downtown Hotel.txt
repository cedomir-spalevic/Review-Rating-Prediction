I spent an afternoon noon at the Renaissance Hotel for a professional conference on the the 3rd floor. This was a lunch with coffee and dessert. The presentation of the food was great , Nice and classy. They had wait staff that was very attentive and courteous. I was able to sit through the conference without being uncomfortable or too tired. Overall the hotel feels updated , but the ambiance is a little dark and "clubby" which is not my style. The lobby is open and spacious, a little rough to know where to go as the front desk is tucked around a wall.

I stayed once before and I didn't have a great experience. However; I decided to stay again and was wowed by the service and staff. I was given an upgrade. First time ever as a Marriott Gold! Quite a room! Love the location because you can be in the Loop and navigate the rest of the city well. I got room service and food at the bar as well as the Lounge. The front desk was great and almost everyone emphasized their focus on service and guest well being.

I had drinks outside at raised and really enjoyed it. The music inside was right up my alley and outside was nice because there were heat lamps everywhere. Good location and view.

The hotel is nice, the staff are super friendly and helpful. There is a limited dine in menu, but the Mushroom Bisque was divine. I only wish better soundproofing had been used when making the rooms. I'm up at 3am because of city sounds & my meeting doesn't start til 8. It's going to be a long day.

If you are visiting their rooftop bar, check your bank account after couple days!
Their server has changed the bill and charged me extra (seems like decided to give her more tip!!!). I tried to reach out to their manager several times and left two messages so far; He is not responsive at all! 
If you have been to this place in past couple weeks, I strongly recommend you to check your bank account and ensure they have not charged you extra. If you've been charged extra, then good luck cause you cannot find the manager to resolve the issue.
