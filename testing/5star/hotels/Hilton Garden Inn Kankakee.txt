Excellent customer service. My family & I experience a house fire and our insurance company set us up here. Everyone on staff has been absolutely wonderful. From managers, housekeeping, maintenance and front desk managers. EVERYONE has been very nice and accommodating to my family and I. Highly recommend for any occasion.

Last minute decision to stay here due to traffic jams on I57. Got the last room due to same traffic jam.  Whirlpool tub had a weird shower. Otherwise great stay. Clean and comfortable. Comped breakfast by being a Hilton Honors member. Good value.

The room was clean. The lobby was clean and welcoming. There were cookies and water laid out as you entered the lobby. The gym is small but adequate. The check in process was quite slow but it's understandable as there was an emergency of someone fainting and collapsing somewhere in the hotel. Overall it's a clean hotel and I'd stay here again if I need a hotel nearby.

The staff is very polite. The swimming pool and fitness center are in good shape. Not the biggest I have seen but I never had a problem getting what I needed. It is right off the highway so very easy to get to. The breakfast is not free but they will make you what you would like which is nice. Overall, a great place to stay
