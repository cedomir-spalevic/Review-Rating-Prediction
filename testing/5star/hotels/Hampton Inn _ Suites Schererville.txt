I really enjoyed my stay there. This is our second stay and it was just as good both times. They have a good selection for the continental breakfast. We were able to pretty much have the pool to ourselves. They are friendly and helpful.

Great hotel. Good amenities, clean, and well laid out. Nice complimentary breakfast with waffle machines. The suite was really well laid out. Parking was easy.

The lady at the front desk was extremely polite and explained everything clearly. Room was clean and everything was where it should be. Not a single complaint at all
