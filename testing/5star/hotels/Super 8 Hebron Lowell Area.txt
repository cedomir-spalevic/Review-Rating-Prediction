The staff is really nice. It was a quiet stay. The room was clean for the most part with the exception of spider webs in multiple corners in the room completely visible and easy to access. The motel is under renovation at this time so there is less room for them to accomodate the guests with breakfast and no microwave as they claim they dont have the room. The grounds have a lot of garbage around it and junky furniture for outdoor seating. Looks rundown outside to be honest but the reason for me staying here is that they allow dogs. I would not have stayed here otherwise.

Its a motel. It served its purpose and there is a Denny's close by. Easy access to the Highway and everything is on par for the price. Good stay!

It is under New ownership. They have really cleaned the motel up. They have fixed the things that needed fixed. NEW beds, carpet, paint and fixed the things that needed to be fixed. Still have some small things to finish up but they have really done a great job so far.

Like most Super 8 this was a clean quick and easy place to stay.  The  breakfast included waffles, yogurts, cereal, oatmeal along with some sweet rolls.
