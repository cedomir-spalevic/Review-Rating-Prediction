Came here for theater with friends. Hotel is wonderful, great location, great food at happy hour and super bartenders.  Gerry Medina went above and beyond to assist us with all of our needs the entire stay. Ravi the doorman was always helpful, smiling, and of great assistance. Highly recommend this hotel. Quiet and classy with excellent service.

Excellent location, and atmosphere. Very cleaned and silenced hotel. The hospitality it's awesome and the offer you free drinks for the afternoon from 5to 8 pm. The breakfast is offered at every hotel floor to enjoy in your room. It's a continental breakfast. I will come back.

First time we stayed here. Perfect location to most places. Everyone who worked there was awesome. Room was clean and modern.... great happy hour... only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars was BREAKFAST! I wasn't complaining what they had on it, I complained because you get your breakfast and go back and bring it to your room! I did not like that. I'm big on breakfast.... I wanted somewhere to sit and enjoy my coffee and oatmeal... but as far as service, friendliness and overall comfort... loved it!❤️

The Kinzie is elegant, chic, beautifully decorated. The service is impeccable. I have to believe it must be a good place to work too because I have stayed here at least once a year for the last 3 years and have seen the same employees. This hotel is always my first choice when I visit Chicago. The location is great too, because it is within walking distance to many great restaurants, attractions and the Navy Pier.

Beautiful city view room on the 6th floor. Rooms were clean, beds were comfy and the bathroom with lighted makeup mirror, makeup removal towel and vanity stool were awesome. Breakfast could be improved the croissants and bread items were not fresh...very dry and hard. But I won't knock a hotel for their free breakfasts as most are not the greatest. The location was perfect and had easy access to river walk and the navy pier. Would stay again!
