Very nice facility. Very nice neighborhood. Very friendly staff. Very comfortable beds. I can't think of any improvement that could be made. Perfect for a romantic getaway.

I went and saw the hotel during the Open House Chicago weekend and it was fantastic to look at all the details of the architecture.

My husband and I stayed at the Wheeler Mansion from 12/21/2016 to 12/28/2016. 

Location is great!  Close to Soldier Field, the museum and aquarium as well as walking distance from restaurants and shopping.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  So much more personal and individual than staying in a hotel.  The room was beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable. The bed had to be the most comfortable bed I ever slept in. We were out for most of the day but upon returning to our room it was as neat and clean as the day we checked in.

Breakfast Buffet, with an assortment of hot and cold items was plentiful and very good.  Great way to start the day.

Staff was outstanding!  They were friendly personable, warm and eager to please.  Cognizant of our privacy yet willing to engage in enjoyable conversation.

The entire home was stunning with obvious thought, warmth and personal care in renovations. 

I highly recommend The Wheeler Mansion and intend to stay there again during our next visit to Chicago.

Would not recommend!
Do yourself a favor and Stay in a normal hotel
They have a long way to go to understand how too accommodate clients...
They call themselves 4 star?

It was a wonderful experience. The staff met us at our car and offered to help with luggage. The atmosphere was beautiful and the room was very cozy. Breakfast was delicious as well.
