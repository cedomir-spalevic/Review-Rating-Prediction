The reason alone I give it 2 stars is that there was pubic hair in the bathtub upon inspection. The TVs are antiques and that's ok, but it would've made up for it with a damn remote and more than 20 channels. For the $50 though it works.

The room was nice, except for the mold on the ceiling and the pipe leaking under the sink, which had water everywhere.
