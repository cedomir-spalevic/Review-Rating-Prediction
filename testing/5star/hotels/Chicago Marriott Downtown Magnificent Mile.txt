This is a great hotel. It had one of the largest gyms I have seen in a hotel in awhile. Come on, they have battle ropes, in a hotel gym. The service is good and find are pretty big. Everything is clean and well maintained. You can't ask for more in a hotel, and if you did I'm sure they would oblige you.

I attended a conference here.  The rooms were clean.  The staff was quiet but friendly.  The food was good.  Water, tea, and coffee were always available.

Rooms are nicely redecorated, but it's an old building and windows are not well sealed. So even on a high floor street noise is very evident (and there's a lot of it). Also, elevator noise could be clearly heard, even though I was three rooms away. Also, AC unit was noisy and rattled. Not a place for a light sleeper. 

First room I was given had no hot water. It seems incredible that the hotel would not be aware of this, did they think guests wouldn't notice? I called down and they said they would send maintenance up. Didn't happen for a while and I had a meeting, so had to take a cold shower. Then the maintenance guy showed up, confirmed the problem and left. Later when I came back, nothing had been done, so I called back down and finally was given another room. 

Staff were trying their best, I think. Every member of staff that I dealt with was friendly and helpful (except for that maintenance guy).

The view of the city and the lake was amazing. Everything from the bed to the shower seemed luxurious, and it was the perfect location relative to everything we did that night. All for a reasonable price (as far as downtown Chicago hotels go!)

A great experience from the lobby to the room. Excellent location that makes it easy to get anywhere in downtown Chicago. Harvest is a great restaurant also.
