The hotel was centrally located and provided easy access to some nice restaurants and good shopping. The breakfast buffet was also pretty decent. However, we did have some negative issues. After being told at check-in that our luggage would be brought right up, we sat in our rooms for about 30 minutes and had to go back down to get our bags ourselves. We also had issues getting our room cleaned on the second day. We called for service at about 4:30 pm and were told someone would be right up. We called again at about 5:40 when no one had shown up yet. Finally, after no response by 6:15, I went down in person. They finally sent someone up. For what we spent on our stay, I would have expected better service. I give it 3-stars for the great location, but we will not be staying here again, unfortunately.

Great location with everything within a 15 minute walk. The rooms are clean and well organized. Everything looks brand new and flawless. There is complimentary hot breakfast and dinner and an in door pool and gym! I was so impressed with the hotel and it has to rank in the top 5 hotels I've ever stayed in.

We had a king suite and the room was very spacious and comfortable. The location was also very good for all the shopping and eating we wanted to do. We parked our car in an iparkit lot on the next street which was cheaper than parking with the hotel so I would definitely recommend that.

I also want to give a special shout out to Javier in maintenance and also the concierge working Saturday (10/14) morning. we did not have a full length mirror in the room (a necessity when planning outfits). At first they told us they did not have any but an hour or so later Javier came and installed one for us. Needless to say we were very excited (maybe unreasonably so).  Overall we had a great stay.

We had a great experience at this hotel. The front desk printed out directions for us and were always helpful when we asked questions. Room was clean and comfortable.  During the evening social, Guillermo (?) offered to make my kids something different which was super considerate. We would definitely return this hotel. It was a great location and everyone was always helpful and cheerful.

The suite was clean and comfortable, with a fridge, microwave, sink, and hot plate. Even the pull out bed was comfortable. There was some city noise through the windows, but not so much to prevent sleep. The hot breakfast was pretty good, although it does get busy. The location was great. Parking nearby was $49 for 24hrs.
