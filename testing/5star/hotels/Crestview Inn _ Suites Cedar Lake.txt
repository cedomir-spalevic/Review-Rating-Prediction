Had my reservation 3 weeks before my stay. Because of traffic I arrived an hour after my check in time only to find out that my room was not ready. Still needed to be cleaned, which was done right away however the room was itself still dirty. The venue I was going to, if I ever go back I'll find a nicer place a bit further away.

FIRST OF ALL THE MAN WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE WHEN U CALL DOES NOT LIVE IN THE STATE, that was the 1st sentence the Lady in the office told us.  My husband and I needed a place for a week stay, we walked in with our 18 month old son, the lady said she had one room for someone with a child (the other ones had new carpet or was recently  remodeled) she gives us a key and points across the drive for us to check it out. My husband opens the door and wouldn't even let us walk in! The smell of cigarette and old dirty sex just BLEW out of the room! DISGUSTING! Obviously we drove away. Don't waste ur time driving out to that *H#%hole.
