I had a two queen bed room and one of the bedspreads was stained inside and out. The other  bedspread had a cigarette burn hole in it. The bathroom had not even been cleaned as someone had bad aim for the toilet and the tub was dirty. I did not use the shower and only went in the bathroom with shoes on. You could barely get the bathroom door open because the height of the carpet wedges the door on the carpet. The last issue was with the room door. You could push or pull the door open without turning the handle. You had to lift the door after you closed it in order for it to lock. Once closed and locked, you had to lift the door to unlock and open it. Sorry, although this place has been nicely updated, I won't be back.

Room was alot nicer than I thought it would be.  Was pretty clean. Had a little different smell when walking in to the room. But not deadly!  Bed was comfy. Here for only four hours to sleep but  I would definitely come back.

The staff is very friendly and personable.  This a a great value and the room is kept tidy and clean.  The shower is very powerful and high quality and the cleaning staff is available.  I didn't have any concerns with the hotel and would highly recommend this hotel when travelling HWY 57 Chicago.

Our first night stay was ok but we could not keep the same room so we moved down the hall towards the smoking section which had an awful loud marijuana smell.  We did not stay in the room long before we noticed a bed bugs on the bed comforter. We left the room with all our belongings I showed the people downstairs the photos of the bugs and we left.
