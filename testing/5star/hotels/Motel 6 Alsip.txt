We arrived late at night (midnight) after a long day in Chicago and were poorly received by staff. First, we were told there was no reservation under our name. Then reservation was found but needed to be paid (although we paid in advance). Once that was solved, we were given keys to our bedroom. At this point it was close to 1am. As we entered our room, we noticed it smelled like cigarettes, there were different stains in our bed sheets and chewing gum on the carpet. The shower had almost no hot water. Overall, an incredibly frustrating experience. I would stay away from this place if I were you.

The hotel was clean enough, and the front desk person was nice. The room could use a coffee maker and more towels. I had one each of a hand towel, bath towel, bath cloth. Had to go out for a cup of coffee.

After driving 7+ hrs I was notified that I no longer had my reservation that I made in January at this hotel because they switched from a Days Inn to a Motel 6... I was NEVER notified of any changes nor that my reservation was not being honored. There was not a manager available and no further help was offered besides "I guess you can call corperate". I was also told that the switch had just happened 2 days prior and that they had completely filled all of their rooms within that time. The entire situation was handled VERY poorly. My husband and I were forced to stay at a hotel where we questioned the safety of ourselves and our belongings, however they were still more 'accommodating' than this Motel 6 in Alsip.

One star because I can't give it 0.

Let me start this review by saying I did NOT book with Motel 6, and I didn't book with them for a reason.  The hotel I booked with was bought out by Motel 6 and I was not notified until I arrived, making it too late to make a change.  NO breakfast was included (well, coffee....that's not breakfast).  NO hot water in my room for the 3 days I stayed there, I had to shower in different rooms.  The cleaning crew came in and left my blinds WIDE OPEN for everyone to see my personal belongings while I was away all day.  No blow dryers.  No refrigerators, or microwaves.  Smoking rules were NOT enforced and my entire room smelled like smoke ALL DAY LONG!  Smokers were smoking directly outside their rooms and right by my air conditioning intake.  Nothing was done about this.

Beds were so hard I might as well of slept on the floor.  And crappy half size pillows provided!  HORRIBLE!  Didn't sleep at all the 3 nights I stayed there.

Staff was extremely rude and not at all understanding.  WORST HOTEL STAY EVER!!!

The rooms walls are paper thin and so are the doors. Id stay if i was passing through n just needed a bed but to go for a romantic get away, probably not.
