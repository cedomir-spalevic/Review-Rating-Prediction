Price is good because of the location to downtown; it should be the cheapest motel/hotels from downtown overpriced ones.
It does not have all the amenities of a 5 star hotel, which you might never use, despite be charged, there are at least no bedbugs_ something I fear the most from cheap motels.
It has free parking in the courtyard, close to Marianos, and Michigan ave buses. Overnight parking downtown $57.. It has security cameras too.
So if you want to save money, I guess it's a good deal to stay here.Thanks for reading.

They have nice clean rooms. The location is about 8mins from downtown Chicago and 4 minutes from White Sox park 2mintues from the 94 Expressway. The staff were very professional and accommodating. Most places allow you to check in at 4:00pm or the earliest check in by 12:00noon if the room is ready. I was allowed to check in at 8:00am for a special quest to have their room when they arrived from out of town. There is a banquet hall and soul food restaurant connected to this hotel along with a barbeque restaurant across the street.
Public Transportation is right outside the hotel. The hotel is two blocks east of State Street allowing you to take the 29 State Street bus to downtown Navy Pier.
