My stay at the Travelodge Hotel was fairly average. Staff was nice enough, the room was not too dirty. I really only had two issues. 1. No channel guide for the TV. With about 40 available channels spread across 1-99, you have to go through each channel one at a time to figure out what's what. 2. The fitted sheet was not a fitted sheet and did not cover the whole bed, meaning my feet kept touching the mattress pad. It was weird but I was able to get over it. On the positive side, the hotel is super close to a lot of attractions and it is very affordable.

We very much enjoyed our stay here! Our hotel room was clean, and the front desk allowed us to "check" a bag for the day after check out so we could explore before heading to the airport. A word of caution - we ordered too much deep dish pizza and didn't realize we didn't have a refrigerator or microwave for leftovers. On the second of our 4 night stay, we told room service that we were okay without service for the day, and I believe she took that as we didn't need room service for the rest of our stay. Our fault, but we wish we would have communicated better.

The location is great, and the rooms are nice and clean. The people from the hotel was nice too, and it has a great place for breakfast in the next door. The only issues was the noise. Is close to the subway, so you can hear it since very early in the morning if your room face it. Beds are not amazing neither. But overall it was a good experience! I would stay again.

The location is great. It is very walkable and transit friendly. The room was acceptable given its 2 star status. The bathroom sink was slightly cracked. The toilet was too close to the wall. The showerhead had very little pressure. The bed was comfortable. I had a decent stay but I have no reason to return.

Was meeting and friend here before the Chicago Marathon. This is an amazing location to stay if you are in town for the Chicago Marathon. It's some close to the start and finish line. And it's verbal reasonably priced for that weekend.
