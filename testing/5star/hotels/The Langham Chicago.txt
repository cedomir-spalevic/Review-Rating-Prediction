We had a fantastic experience here for my birthday celebration! We did the afternoon tea and it was truly divine.  the service was top notch and the food was absolutely delicious. The SCONES were the best I have ever tasted! The host even gave my little girl a bear from the gift shop which made her day! 
We cant wait for more family occasions so we can return!

Wow! Worthy of a celebrity and from what I hear, a good chance you'll see one! Amazing location, impeccable service, rooms are superb but beds almost too soft. Great bar and really good food (even room service). The bathroom is exactly what you wish you had at home. The Langham has thought of everything even down to the trademark scent when you walk in the front door. Definitely one of the best hotels in the country!

I've only stayed at a few five star hotels, but The Langham was likely the best of the bunch. The overall attention to detail in the room was fantastic, from decor to technical amenities I was thoroughly impressed. Everything about the layout of the room was thoughtful, especially the bathroom. It was a great experience and I'll happily stay there again.

Amazing service! Went here for Sunday tea and was treated like royalty! Extensive tea menu and everything was delicious and reasonably priced. Definitely will go again!

Lovely rooms, as you'd expect from Langham. The spa facilities are nice. The pool is OK - I expected it to have a bit more atmosphere, and/or to be offered a cold towel/drinking water pool side; but nothing like that.
