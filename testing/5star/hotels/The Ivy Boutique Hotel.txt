Fantastic service! Rooms are sizable and ample, and the showers are pretty great. The daily cookie delivery is a nice, sweet touch. The staff was all very helpful and great to speak with and overall had no issues during my stay. Only downside was that the rooftop bar closed early on a Sunday, wish it was open longer!

A very beautiful hotel with an excellent location in the heart of Streetorville. The rooms are beautiful and well appointed with exception of the damn ice bucket. The rooftop bar is very nice, beautiful view and a good pour for the money. Park your car yourself using spot hero as parking is about $60 if you do it through the hotel.There’s no pool or exercise facilities, but planet fitness is around the corner and they do give you a voucher for a yoga class if you’re into that thing.

Attended a wedding here. Arrived a bit early, so went to the rooftop terrace. Drink prices were reasonable for downtown Chicago. Ballroom was nice for an intimate wedding, but food service was a bit slow during the reception.

Super cute, trendy, large room with separate living room area. Beautiful finishes. Comfortable beds, lower than most. Hotel is in great location. Staff was helpful. Valet is $52 per day. Rooftop closes in inclement weather.

Perfect location, great staff and over all an awesome experience. The rooms are incredible. Our veiw could have been better but that is barely worth mentioning.
