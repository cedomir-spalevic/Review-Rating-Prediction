We stayed in room 1015. It was exceptionally quiet. We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. Parking is confusing at first, but once you locate the Embassy entrance coming and going is easy. The pool was nice as well. The staff at the desk was helpful and friendly. We will stay here again. I would have preferred more water pressure in the shower, but it would not keep me from staying here. The pull out bed was comfortable for our son. We also loved the extra sink in the bedroom.

The location is excellent. It is within walking distance to shops on Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park area. The staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were very clean. They have a great happy hour where you get 4 free drinks each night from 5 to 7pm and they have snacks out. They lost a star because they have satellite tv... which means when it's too windy or raining then you can't get any TV. Considering thus is Chicago and they are right by the river, that doesn't seem very smart.

Small pool for hotel geared to families. Slippery floor in the kitchen area where you went to get your breakfast. We love the place. Great location. Great room / Suite. Breakfast was very good.. excellent mattress.

Nice stay, really close to some of the best parts of Chicago. I stayed for business but it would be great for families too. Included breakfast was a good way to start the day but follow the staff's advice and go earlier. It gets busy. Only complaint, the walls seem a bit thin. Didn't bother me too much except for the baby crying next door in the middle of the night. Even still, very pleased with the stay.

This is the best hotel ever!! You walk in, past the friendly concierge, and take the elevators to the lobby where check-in is. The staff are all very friendly. In the middle of the large hotel is an atrium where breakfast and fountains are. The elevators to the room balconies are super fast, and they are glass-backed for amazing views. 

The hotel rooms are very spacious and modern. We got one on the corner of the building so we could see the lake when the sun rose. Beds were super comfortable. This is an amazing hotel, I totally recommend it!
