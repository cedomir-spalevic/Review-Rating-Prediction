Nice sized room and comfortable bed. Would have preferred a king bed, not sure why a hotel would have queen or double beds primarily. Bathroom lighting could be better as there is only on pretty dim light. Public space is nice, the social hour is a nice touch. Breakfast was good, selection covered all bases and was very conveniently laid out. Gym was basic but worked for the purpose. Overall an nice place to stay, would recommend or stay again.

I'm not used to staying in a suite so I'm not sure what's expected but the room is large, has a work desk, a small dining table in the kitchen, and a couch. King-sized beds are apparently very limited. There is a full fridge and freezer, microwave, a stovetop, dishwasher and utensils and a few plates and a pot but if u want to actually cook something from scratch you'll at least need your own spices. Small indoor pool and workout room. Complimentary breakfast (eggs, sausage, fruit etc.) and a happy hour with beer, wine and some grub.

The rooms are clean and pretty nice. They serve at least breakfast and dinner on weekdays, both of which were not terrible. The staff have all been very courteous and helpful in every interaction.
