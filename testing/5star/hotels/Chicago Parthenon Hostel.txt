Not very clean. Super thin walls. I couldn't sleep because of the noise from the bar three floors below. No individual control over air conditioning. Over-priced and they charge for everything. They even charged $2 to watch my bag for a couple hours. I'm glad it was only two nights.

Good location and price. However, the two single bed room I booked had a couple Maintanence issues, including 2 electrical sockets with exposed wiring, the walls and ceiling are looking a little worse for wear, with some water and physical damage. The first floor women's showers did appear to have a mold issue. That said, I did enjoy my stay and would stay again.

The rooms are roomy! The breakfast is free! The showers are very nice! The Parthenon Hostel is the whole package. Highly satisfied.

Worst hostel ever. Unfriendly staffs and misleading room sizes from description. On top of that, they have only one Men's toilet for an entire floor. There is always a queue in front of the toilet. What an horrible experience for a group! Breakfast is so poor as well. You can get a cheap hotel with more amenities at the same price. Feeling so regretful
