Blood, hair and bread crumbs in bed!
First of all, the front desk cheat me that they are booked out so they can't offer me an upgrade at check-in, which they weren't.
Then when I got in to the room, I saw 3 hairs in bed. 3! I really doubt if they changed the sheets.
I went to the front desk and asked for a room change. There was no apology, they just gave me the key to another room, which was a suite.
When I went to the second room, I found hair on the pillow, blood on the pillow, and bread crumbs in bed! Did they really clean the room?
They I got the second room change. By this time, I finally heard an apology. And I've been switched to another suite. It is also ironic that they told me they are booked out at checking-in
When checking out, they offered me extra 500 points (about $3) as a compensation. This makes me feel even worse. 500 POINTS????

Terrible service, had to cancel and they would not refund any of my money.  I had three days prepaid.  Will never stay at a Holiday Inn Express again and I will advise my friends to do the same.   I can see charging a crenelation fee but this is pretty much theft.

I don't get to stay at hotels much, but the room was excellent. Very clean, staff was very nice, free breakfast was delicious, and the wifi was very fast. Would definitely recommend.

Very nice hotel, comfy beds and clean room. Breakfast was ok. But this is a shady area, I'm here on business, would not think of bringing my family to this area.
