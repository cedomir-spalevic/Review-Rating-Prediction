Stayed here for the Chicago marathon and I couldn't rave any more about this place if I tried! Staff were amazing. The amenities were on point. Most comfortable beds and such a central location. Also the hotel restaurant is top notch too!

Love Kimpton hotels and this one did not disappoint. Friendly and professional staff. Start off with the valet welcoming us as though we were old friends. Next, we meet up with the desk clerk and she was super friendly and totally excited for why we were visiting Chicago. 
Our room was wonderful. Great style, very spacious and awesome floor to ceiling windows. 
Location is great too. We were a short walk or Uber ride from where we wanted to go. 
Will definitely stay here again!

Favorite hotel in Chicago - the people who work here make every stay absolutely special.  I brought my mom here for a night to celebrate her final chemo treatment, and the kindness of the staff was so beyond what I expected or imagined.  I am loyal for life and recommend this lovely, perfectly located boutique hotel every chance I get.

Great location.    Staff was super friendly.    The drinks at the bar attached to the hotel were excellent and were better than lots of other places around the hotel.   2 min walk to shopping.   Would definitely stay again.
