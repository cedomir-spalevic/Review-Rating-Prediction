Mostly good. Room was pretty small but wasn't too cramped. We had to wait over 10 minutes for them to get us another pillow. When I asked for ear plugs at night they said they would send some up but when the guy came he only had a "sleep kit" which had a face mask, some tea, and a smelly oil, no ear plugs. Otherwise service was very good everyone was nice and professional.

Location is really great, close to everything you'll need. You can easily take the subway, rent a bike or even go walking to whatever place you want to visit. Our room was clean, the size was acceptable and there was a pretty complete kitchen in there. The Wi-Fi was not good though, there was no safe box in the room, the hotel does not offer breakfast and the lady who told us this was not kind. Fortunately, youâ€™ll find a Corner Bakery pretty close to the hotel, which offers great stuff for your breakfast for a pretty decent price. Despite the mentioned lady, the hotel staff are friendly and the hotel is good.

The staff was very friendly and very helpful. Check in was super fast. Room was a little outdated, but very clean. Bathroom was very clean as well. Bed was comfy, room was a good size. Would definitely recommend this place to stay. A quick walk to different shops and restaurants. Will for sure be staying here again.

My room was nicely furnished with a large tv, work desk and walk in shower. There is a nice restaurant and bar in the lobby as well as a fitness center. There are complementary refillable water bottles on each floor with chilled filtered water. This is a great location for business travellers.

The rooms are small, the heaters don't work and parking is ridiculously expensive ($53/day valet -- better to self-park nearby on Federal St.), but I still somehow enjoyed my stay. The employees there are very courteous, my bed was huge, and the hotel is relatively well-located (a little far from Wrigley but not that far from Soldier Field). Plus I got a stellar deal at $100/nt. At that price, I highly recommend it.
