The hotel was very hard to find and even when we did we couldn't tell until talking to front desk. Once we got to the room and understood the layout, everything was great! The room was clean and the view was phenomenal! The view is worth the stay and the club is just bonus. The mini bar was not over priced and the water pressure is good with warm water. Room is somewhat dated but bed is comfortable. We will definitely stay here again if we stay in Chicago!!

Everything was excellent. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms clean and comfortable. Really my only complaint was that the remote didn't control the tv, only the cable box. We will definately stay here next time we are in Chicago.

It was a little confusing at first to navigate your way around but once you've done it twice it becomes easy. Rooms are spacious and clean nice view of the city. Staff was friendly and courteous.

I stayed here for 4 nights and would absolutely recommend it. The rooms are on the 40th floor and I believe all the rooms have amazing views as mine sure did. The location was perfect for getting to all the major tourist attractions. Subway station is literally around the corner. Bed was comfy and apparently they have an awesome gym available for guests.

Our room was fairly large and very clean. It may not be the most convenient hotel inside the loop, but it's right next to a metro station. Our view was amazing. If you can, ask to be on the north or east side of the building. Straight out from our window was the back of the Rookery building and Willis Tower was off to the left. Being on the 40th floor means you get a truly amazing view. For the price, I'm not sure there's a better place to stay in the loop. The security to get into the building and having to take two separate elevators is a little annoying, but it's also nice to know that no one will just go wandering into the hotel area. Would definitely recommend this.
