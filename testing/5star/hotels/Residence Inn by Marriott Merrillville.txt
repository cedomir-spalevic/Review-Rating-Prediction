This hotel is awesome! Clean, spacious rooms and amazingly friendly staff! I have stayed at this Residence Inn a few times recently and they really do have amazing people that go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. I was a bit late for the dinner they offer, but when I walked through the door, they offered me dinner and a drink, which is just what I needed after a day at work! I would highly recommend this hotel!

Very nice place with all of the amenities and space that a business traveler needs. My room is huge, two rooms with a well equipped kitchen, full size refrigerator and an air conditioner that really does the job - I like my rooms cold. There's a pool, hot tub, nice exercise room, a full hot breakfast and a meal/sizeable snack most evenings. I'm very pleased with this place.

I was there in July for a week and returned August 15 because John was very pleasant. John was forced to quit. I travel 30 days at a time and extend up to 90 days. This time I noticed many things wrong. 
A lady got bed bugs in room 320. When she told the GM (Matthew Baron) he did not follow through. I read a review that it happened to a lady two months ago. This means the problem is not solved. 
The dinners are limited. On hamburger night they ran out of lettuce and tomatoes by 6:30 when dinner goes until 7:30. Fruit is not available for breakfast on the weekends and they run out early during the week. 
The pool is cold. More cold than other hotels. The spa broke over a week ago and it is still not fixed. A  group of  teenagers showed up with speakers and played music. When I told the front desk I was told they go there yearly. Mom just stood there. I pay them $99 for 30 days. This is a steady income for them. Cutting corners, staff hours and not fixing items generates a bonus. I feel the GM is after a bonus. When I mentioned why I was leaving no one could blame me. A sign that there is some truth to my guess. I stayed long enough.   :(

Not for families! Business ppl yes wonderful hotel ppl were great... except Sarah she is an awful person rude to my kids! At 7 pm we were told to quiet down or leave. Customer service isn't for her... maybe the laundry room where she doesn't deal w people is a suitable place for her!
