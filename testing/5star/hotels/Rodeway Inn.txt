The staff is nice & let me check out an hour later. Everybody don't d do that for you. If they fix the rooms up it'll be really nice. By the way... I got some good sleep & that don't happen often.

Stay clear from this place. They charge your card right away before you even see the room. Then after I get to the room did not feel comfortable or safe staying here. Sheets on bed looked like they hadn't been washed  for weeks. They whole second floor smelled like everyone was geting high even into our room. I told them I wasn't going to stay the really and they said they can refund all but one night but it would be next week. Not a good hotel to stay or recommend at all.

If I could give 0 stars I would! The hotel doors close and click shut but anyone can just open them! I was robbed over 600$! Found my purse at the end of the hallway. We have it on camera from the hotel. Police were called and made a report. Hotel staff was helpful that night. Police
Found a exit door taped over the lock so anyone can walk in!!!my hotel room (104) was robbed! It was locked and the guy on the camera just walked right in!!' Next day we ask for a refund for our troubles and it was a different front desk person. We said we got robbed and he said there was no one who got stolen from last night!! He was yelling at us! I started to record and he calmed down after he saw me. We did not get a refund the police could
Not find then theif at all... so I'm out over 600$!!' :(

Cigarette burns on the sheets. A door that you have to slam to get it to close and the water coming out of the shower head smelled like dirty bong water. I wish I could give this negative stars.

So terrible! If all you care about is the price than by all means, stay here. Found a beetle type bug in our bathroom, floor panels just broken and exposed, the sheets in a "non smoking" room had burn holes all in them. Sent us to a "better" room. It reaked of bug spray and cigarettes. I could seriously choke walking in. The lobby, elevator, or halls are not air conditioned, nor are the rooms before hand. It's summer, quit being cheap. The third and last room before I just gave up was half decent. Went out and brought back dinner, asked for some plates and the front desk guy hands me one nasty food stained paper plate and said this is all I have. I took pictures of that, that is uncalled for! Came back later to go to bed, pulled back the blankets to all stained sheets and burn holes. The pillows were disgusting. Went down and asked for new, told me they had none. There were maybe 8 cars in the parking lot!? I asked to trade it with an empty rooms and he said no. It took every ounce of patience not to go nuts. They offered a refund but I already paid and it would take 3-5 days to get it back. I planned my whole trip from Las Vegas while driving. I didn't have extra money to go blow on another room last minute. Ridiculous! Never ever again. Those pictures on here are all lies. Stinky, dirty hotel.
