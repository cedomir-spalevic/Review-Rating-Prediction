We stayed here before flying to San Diego for our honeymoon because it was the most cost effective sleep & fly package I could find...next time I will spring for the more expensive option. We had to be given a different room right away because the key card lock was not working. We found roaches in our bathroom in the middle of the night. Breakfast was of very questionable quality. I'm giving two stars because the staff were really friendly and helped as much as they could, but I'd say just opt for something else.

For the money, I've been very satisfied. The staff is courteous and helpful, and have responded quickly to my needs. I'd rate it higher, but the building is being renovated. The transition has created almost no inconvenience, but it would be dishonest to compare it equally to a building not being renovated. I gave it 4 stars more on principle than dissatisfaction.

Horrible customer service!! We booked and got a hotel room and put our baggage in it and then when we came back there were OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR ROOM WITH ALL OUR STUFF IN IT!! And they made us change rooms instead of telling them to get out of the room. Now we have a flight to catch and they wonâ€™t recompensate us for their horrible services! The manger is also very rude and will not respond to Expedia or Best Western Corporate.
