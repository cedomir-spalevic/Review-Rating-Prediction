When I first purchased this hotel I was unsure about how it would be. It had 4/5 star rating but had never been to Chicago before. When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Not only was it gorgeous but it was huge and had different places to get food and there was a convention center under the building where a meeting was happening. The staff was super helpful and even upgraded us which was incredibly appreciated and kind of them. It made me extra happy to stay here. Our room was beautiful and had a view of the river but was also high enough that it was quiet and felt private. The only down side that I could find is that the restaurants are very expensive and looked like they were amazing so I left each time to get food. Other than that, a great stay and hoping to stay there in the future.

I wasn't staying there as an overnight guest, rather I was there for a three-day conference. The hotel is absolutely huge. The first floor seems to have lots of restaurants and bars in a big open space. There are multiple Towers to this hotel expanding across streets. Our conference was down on the third floor below ground level. Conference facilities seem to adequate but nothing to write home about. The catering they had for the conference was decent. I would consider staying there as a guest, I'm sure the rooms are nice. Prime location right of the river off of Wacker Drive.

Here the Becker Health IT Summit.

Hotel staff was amazing when I checked in. He was patient, accommodating, and welcomed me. 

Alvin in security was engaging and helpful when I asked him for directions. He engaged me in conversation and even asked how Houston was doing, extending his thoughts and prayers. 

This will be my go to tho it's expensive. However, worth every cent of comfort value

Good conference venue, well situated downtown on the river. Easy walking to local bars and restaurants. My room was well appointed, but with a surprisingly small bathroom - very little counter space around the sink... The amenities are good: both bars are vibrant, with plenty of room and multiple screens.
