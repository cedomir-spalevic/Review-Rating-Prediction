Room was neat and clean including the bathroom. Bathroom was missing toilet paper which I got from the desk. No big deal. What bothered me was the light smell of cigarette smoke in the room. I am sensitive to that smell and it kind of "bothered" me during my stay especially at night.

I was definitely pleased at the price for the rooms we booked and how easy it was to reserve the rooms. The actual rooms were a bit disappointing-
 bathroom was not cleaned well, both my child and I have a foot fungus from showering in this room
-bedding was worn and stained
no comp breakfast
paid for wifi  ($4.99)and was shut off after only 7.5 hours,unable to connect again after 8am ( was paid for a full 24 hours- no refund offered)
puddle of urine beside toilet
room keys did not always unlock doors- doors stuck or jammed when trying to open
hallways smelled like marijuana
Could hear noises from other rooms and in hallways -thin walls/no  noise barriers

Desiree was a friendly, courteous and professional host. She took good care of checking us in and making us feel welcome. The room was clean and what we expected. I was surprised not see any shampoo/conditioner in the bathroom. And the $5 premium wi-fi kept disconnecting. But, overall, we enjoyed our short stay.

Filthy! Upon entering the room I quickly noticed that they were ants crawling up the table by the bed. I checked behind the table and the beds and found ants crawling back there with a lot of dirt and things that look like Crumbs from food. I called the front office and they came up with bug spray and sprayed around the baseboards at which time I noticed that there was more dirt and food particles throughout. I also noted that  the tops and shelves of the furniture was not thoroughly wipe clean as there were particles  of what appeared to be food there as well . Later in the evening I found ants crawling over the things that I was working on for the next day and I found ants crawling in the bathroom. The next morning I went to the front desk and ask them to please have the room thoroughly cleaned and bug spray sprayed throughout afterwards. I told them that I had moved all the furniture away from the walls to facilitate this.  When I came back late that evening I found that the beds were made but the furniture had not been moved back towards the walls and the floors were not cleaned and I doubt any bug spray was sprayed. I immediately went to the front desk and was very upset because I needed to get some sleep that night. They gave me the key to another room to check out and I found that the conditions were the same, along with crawling ants. I quickly notified the front desk and two people came up to clean around the baseboards and wipe the shelves and tops of furniture and spray bug spray in this room. They did the best they could to clean it quickly so they could get me into this new room however the cleanup job was still not satisfactory. However it was late and I needed to get to sleep. They did help me move my stuff from the first room to the second room.
