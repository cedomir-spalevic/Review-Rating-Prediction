I stay here often and its not a bad hotel.  The people at the front desk are courteous.  I do wish they would change the items on the breakfast menu occasionally. Often there are long black hairs in the bathroom.  I guess its from the housekeeping personnel.  Other than that, decent place to stay.

I had the worst experience at this hotel!!!!!! I was there for a wedding for my niece and I'm disabled and requested a handicapped room,we checked in which they never told my sister and my niece who booked over at least 20 rooms that we would be charged $25 extra each night for a deposit if we rented a movie, if not when we checked out that money would be added back on your card!?!? Then I go into my room and I'm 5ft and the bed was up to the top of my ribs, I had no way of getting up in my bed, I tried and when I did I fell hitting the night stand, the bed from, my oxygen tank, finally meeting my destination "THE GROUND" screaming in pain looking like a star fish on the ground, they showed little to no compassion, everything in that room was lowered for handicapped and wheel chair accessible, accept the bed that night I fell I slept in the chair with an Ottoman, til the next day when maintenance fame in and lowered the bed, so I guess if your handicapped or disabled ask them to lower your bed before you get there.......this happened on September 30th in still healing from that fallðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢

The rude lady "penny" hung up on me. Friday 13th 2017. When I did get them on the phone they were rude. They implied that they can't help me with out a credit card. After I read my information they told me I could cancel until 6pm. When my plans changed I called them an hour later to cancel. They charged me 160$ for a room I did not stay in. I did not check in. I cancelled 3 hours before check in. They stole 160$ without explaining their exploitation policy at the time of sale. These thief's are running there own shady policies against corporate. I know they sold that same room.  They will not make it long enough in this world without learning the very basics in normal phone conversation and honesty. I would have paid twice as much if they explained their reservation policies. These kind of tricks will not keep this location open long.
