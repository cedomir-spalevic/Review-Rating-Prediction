Awesome! Loved the large rooms with refrigerators included. Beautiful large bathrooms. Front desk people very nice!  I liked it better than the Crown Plaza. Some in my group did not like the parking situation which is an open lot.  Lobby nice too.

Nice hotel, good beds, big bathroom and the tub is huge. Seems like a decent area, but I'm in town for an event, so I haven't gotten out much. Few blocks from an L stop that takes you to the north loop, so pretty convenient! There's a few parking areas, first come first serve. I checked in early, so there were plenty of available spots but it could fill up quickly.

The people who work here were nice. They were good with turn down service. The drinks at their bar were well priced. My only knock is having to ask for extra face rags. Two people should get more two rags a piece. That and their "private" lot gate wasn't properly functioning when I arrived (they have a gated and more open lot; must have their parking pass to park in either).All good other than.

The decor would not win any awards, but it was clean, comfortable and I had a nice view of the city. Local delivering restaurants included an Italian  place called Rosati's (famous in Chicago) that had the best chicken noodle soup I had ever tasted. This might have been a fluke as the next day I went and asked for more (in person this time) and to ask for the recipe.  Staff was all very pleasant and helpful with directions.

Beautiful old hotel. The room was very spacious, as was the bathroom. It was clean and comfortable. I loved that I didn't have to pay for parking. The parking area wasn't secure though because the exit gate wouldn't close. We paid more than we would have liked but we were in town for a special occaision.
