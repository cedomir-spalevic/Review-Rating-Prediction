This hotel is cozy and the management nice, I would stay at it again if I have to.
The gym is not really a gym, but is better than nothing. Nice indoor pool and a decent breakfast. My room was clean and very comfy..

Stayed here for a couple nights for work. Overall I really like the place. The beds are incredibly comfy and the staff are friendly. The breakfast is the same breakfast you'll find in most hotels. And the WiFi isn't the best, but it gets the job done.

Pretty good place for the price. The night manager on 9/15/17, Tremell Young, is the nicest, kindest man who went beyond the call of duty to help me out with several issues.
