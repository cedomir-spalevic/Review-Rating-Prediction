Make sure you are in a smoking room if you smoke.  $250 Fine PLUS they will have the police wake you up at 4am and make you leave. The fine I understand. But being kicked out at 4am and a fine?! Yea, I'll NEVER stay here again. Plus bad customer service. Bathrooms are dirty.

My company put me in this hotel for my 34hr reset, since I am a truck driver, My company did this for my comfort. Check out is 11am, I checked in at 5pm and was not supposed to leave until 1am. At 1pm I was told check out was 11 and please leave.

I was putting up with the fact that the room was a smoking room and I am not a smoker. The room looked like it went under some reconstruction but not good at all.

Well I told my company they might reconsider Days Inn for future use.

The staff was very nice. (Hence the 1 star)
The place is Infested with Roaches!!! We found 5 adult roaches and 2 baby roaches running around the bathroom and hotel room door!!! I used YoungLiving essential oils to spray the entire room. This is so disgusting!!!

Lovely staff. The room was very clean. It could use some updates and remodeling, or some fresh paint to life the place up a bit because it does feel old when you walk in. The do allow smoking in certain rooms. The bed was sooooooo comfy. My only complaint is that the hair dryer in our room was not working and there was a coffee maker without a pot ðŸ¤”. I look forward to staying here again next year.

We booked 2 rooms with 5 adults. As my bf walked  across the hall to the other rooms to sit with the other adults. He proceeded back to our room which sat a bum or crackhead in front of our room door, who apparently slipped in the back door with a guest. This hotel has crackheads off the streets waiting to enter at the back door to come in to sleep overnight. My bf is suggesting we find another hotel because he is afraid to leave me alone due to the riff raft. The rooms were clean, we stayed on the second floor. First floor smells of weed as well as the second floor. My rating is based off of the riff raft that enters the hotel. Room is a 3 out of 5.
