The desk clerk was very friendly. The first room we had, had no remote for the TV. That room also had spiders in the tub. The room we were switched to was much better.

This place has mold, bugs, no pool. The air conditioning doesn't work. Rust on the doors bathrooms etc. Place needs to be shut down the worst nightmare I walked in too and straight out of we did not stay here would not stay for millions. I was afraid to bring anything in bc of what would have came back to my home. Broken windows,garbage cans, weeds everywhere.

Rooms appeared to be in order but there were holes patched and un painted every where.
We had 5 rooms and every one in every room complained they got bed bugs. Of coarse when we brought it to the hotels attention they promptly assured us that they didn't have bed bugs.
