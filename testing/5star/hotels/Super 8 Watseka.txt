It is clean but very outdated. There is no desk, but there is a table with 2 chairs that are very uncomfortable, especially if overweight.  The lighting in the room is very bad. The mattress is comfortable,  but not the pillows! The water pressure is very low.4443. No elevator,  very few seats for breakfast.

Reserved room through Wyndham rewards. Check in was quick and easy. The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, pleasant, and helpful. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and spacious enough for a king bed with micro and fridge. Bathroom was clean and spacious enough. Wifi worked well. Entry to our room could be obtained from the parking lot and an inner hall depending on what door we chose to use. Very satisfied. Would stay again.

Overall: standard but very nice. Clean rooms with standard adornments (fridge, microwave, small coffee maker, tv). Slightly dated, but well maintained. Breakfast is limited, but long duration makes working with your schedule easy. Very comfortable beds. AC keeps rooms as hot or cold as you want.

Really, this hotel is all about the price. It is exactly what I expected for $78. The room appeared to be clean. Everything worked as or should. Decor was bland and outdated. Breakfast was free, but was also pretty sparse, eggos, hard boiled eggs, appkes, bananas, cereal, toast, bagels, and yogurt. It's a basic hotel, and a good value.
