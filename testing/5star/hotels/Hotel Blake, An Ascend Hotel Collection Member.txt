Michael at the front desk was great!  I am an early riser for exercise, and he was quite helpful and I felt quite safe in entering/exiting the hotel.  Additionally, when I asked in advance to have my vehicle at 6:15 a.m., it was there waiting for me when I checked out.  The only thing I think I had a little trouble with (and I am quite a clean freak) is that when I went to plug in my laptop and phone to work from the room, the outlets were not real convenient to the work desk and I noticed build-up of dust in those areas where you don't readily see.  All in all, the cleanliness and location were great!  There's a great little coffee/sandwich shop on the next block called Hero, and it's convenient to State Street, Michigan Avenue, and the Loop.  There's also a Gino's East right across the street. The weight room is sufficient for a quick workout while traveling and does fine as long as you aren't expecting your franchised big gym.  Especially if you're traveling for business, this was a great place to stay.

it honestly was such a great place to stay. a gentlemen greeted me at the door, and was very polite. the rooms had really high ceilings and the view wasnâ€™t all that great, it was a brick wall. but hey, it was still really good. the streets were really loud, but we were on like the 2nd or 3rd floor. i enjoyed my stay.

Great location if you want to walk to Grant Park, Buckingham fountain, shops, Garrett's popcorn, theatres,... Gino's East South Loop is across the street. Staff have been helpful, friendly & professional. Rooms are nice; size & views vary. Small frig & microwave in rooms.

Hotel Blake is a chic hotel that is located very close to the fountain and Millennial Park. Also, its a 15 walk to the train station. The popular Meli's cafe is right next door and has a wonderful array of dishes on their menu. The only downside I would say is that they do not gave their own parking lot and there is no complimentary breakfast. All in all, it's still a very nice hotel to stay at with lot of activities to offer.
