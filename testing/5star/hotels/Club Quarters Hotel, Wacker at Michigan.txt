This hotel is perfectly located in downtown Chicago within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. It was easy to find. The staff was very accommodating. The first night there was a slight buzzing noise in our room that we determined was the mini fridge. Since we didn't need the fridge they sent maintenance up to unplug it for us. We did not at first have enough wash cloths for two people in the room, but they brought us up some upon request. There was coffee in our room, but each morning we took advantage of the lounge's coffee, tea, fruit and granola bars. In the afternoon there was soda, candy and various trail mixes available. The bed in our room wasn't the most comfortable but was fine for two nights. We also really appreciated the complimentary bottled water stations on each floor. Overall, especially considering the price, we were extremely happy with out stay here and would definitely return.

Excellent hotel downtown on the river. It's conveniently located in downtown Chicago with great rooms and a great staff. There is a restaurant in the hotel and everything is nearby. You also have a view of the river in some rooms. Definitely recommend for anyone in Chicago.

Great location. Rooms are relatively small, but is enough.  Good service.  Water filling stations on the floors for bottled water.  Clean and comfortable beds.

Great Location. Great view if you get it. The rooms are super small for how expensive they are. We did a Priceline. 1st night was a double bed vs queen with a view of nothing. No hair dryer. 2nd and 3rd nights we moved to a room on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the river, 2 twin beds, a refrigerator, microwave, and a hair dryer crammed into a tiny room. The TV wasn't really working and the guaranteed super fast Internet we had on the 1st night was no where to be found. All employees were great and an added bonus of water filling stations on every floor as well as a coffee machine was great. Overall, for the price, I'd go somewhere else next time.
