Good location, nice staff, but priced high for the size of the rooms. Our corner suite had a wall that cut deeply into the shower space as well as some damaged panels. There are better options in the area for similar, and sometimes even less, money. Business lounge is decent and there are snacks provided. Workout centre is better than average, although still on the small side. Hotel was very clean.

I had a very small room in one of the upper floors. Also the stairwells were very tiny. I don't want to be there, when everyone tries to rush out in a case of emergency. The room was very dark and the windows were  dirty. One big plus point: The breakfast was excellent. Personally it was the best breakfast I ever had in the US. It was very tasty and the staff members were really cool. Next time I will stay in another hotel and go there only for breakfast.

It was a lovely hotel facing the river, sadly our room faced a another boring building. It was very clean, very modern, and reasonably comfortable. Parking was not clear on their website, and it turned out you have to use their valet service which is all additional $50. Aside from the parking, they were very accommodating. They have a complimentary luggage storage, so we were able to check out explore the city and then return for our bags and car which saved us the trouble of finding parking downtown. It is in a great location, about a 10 min walk to Millennium Park.

It's a great location with friendly staff. Our booking could have been better organized. They forgot to set up the extra bed. There was no turn down. Insufficient towels and cups for the number of guests. 

Staff really helpful to correct the issues.

Room was clean and comfortable. The location was extremely convenient and it was only a few minutes walk to the subway, park, and restaurants and bars. On my last day, they we're even installing gigabyte internet. I would stay here again next time visiting Chicago.
