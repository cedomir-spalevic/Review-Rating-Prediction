Stayed here for one night after flying into o'hare. Really nice staff. Wine hour is a nice touch: 5-6pm. Most of the rooms have huge cozy window seats about four feet off the ground. Makes you feel like a kid looking down over the river. Highly recommended.

This hotel was great and I'm not quick to hand out 5 star reviews. Bed was comfy. Views were amazing g. Window seats were cool place to sit and watch the city. Sign up for their rewards and they give you 10 bucks to raid the mini bar or the bar in the hotel.

What a wonderful experience. The best location. Friendly staff. Clean and comfy. The best part the window seat - big enough for two and overlooking the river.

This is our go to hotel in Chicago. It's on Wacker and Wabash and we make sure to go to their restaurant, South Water Kitchen because I love the PB&J grilled cheese! The kids love to sit in the window of the hotel room. We'll definitely be back!
