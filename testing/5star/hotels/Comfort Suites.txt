Hotel double charged my card when my family and I stayed during a family reunion. I was not the only family member who had problems with billing. The hotel refused to call the bank to rectify the situation.  The authorization charge has been on hold 7 days after the final charge posted to my card. A simple call from them to merchant services would have fixed the issue.  However, Monica would not call, and the manager (Calene) refused to speak with me.  We spent a lot of money with this hotel, and they were not worth what we were charged.

My daughter found this hotel for us. We were in town for a funeral. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. The microwave and refrigerator were an added bonus. We recommend this place and will return under different circumstances.

Traveling with my children, I was so happy at how well the staff here accommodated us. We drove off the highway and saw their sign immediately. The gentleman at the desk even upgraded me to a much larger room. You don't get service like that anymore. Room seemed to have newer furniture and AC was blowing cold. All in all a great find off the highway, and will be staying here on my drive back. Thank you.

Wifi was very slow on the third floor but the room was overall good. The breakfast had a good amount of variety.
