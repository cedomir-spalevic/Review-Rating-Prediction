I don't even know where to begin. Our stay was beyond fantastic! Upon arrival Keenan our concierge who checked us is was AMAZING! He was super friendly accommodating my spouse an I. Bring it was my first time visiting Chicago he made sure we were equipped with a room with a BEAUTIFUL view of the water front, Navy pier etc. I couldn't be more thankful it made my stay even better. Thank you Keenan. The hotel is equipped with a nice size pool my spouse loves to swim so that was his first stop and he wasn't disappointed at all. Being we are New Yorkers we didn't know everything around closed quite early for our time frame so we ended up having dinner right downstairs in the hotel lobby in which we thoroughly enjoyed. Our stay was beyond magnificent I couldn't be more pleased with staff members who greeted us every chance they got and were so pleasant. The room was very spacious and beautiful. Loved every moment.

A very nice hotel. Convenient location and nice, comfortable rooms. The bar has a nice selection of beers and cocktails. Rooms are spacious, clean and we'll furnished. Bathroom is clean and spacious as well. Bathrobes provided for guests as well as coffee and WiFi.

A nice hotel in a reasonable location. Located on the river, it is easy to walk around downtown from here with lots of options for dining nearby. A few minutes walk from the subway and taxis readily available by the lobby

The rooms are nice, and the beds are comfortable.

The breakfast is fine but hosted in a basement room with little ambiance.

However, the two occasions I tried to  find a bellboy to store / retrieve my luggage I had to hunt rather than them being readily available.

We arrived on time, and got off to a rocky start. First, we were told our room was not ready, and we need to wait for a hour. After some conversation about what was right, the young was able to get us a room. I and my daughter was happy. The room was very nice and clean. Thank you!

The hotel was modern and featured great amenities including an impressive workout facility, hit tub, and pool. They also host two bar restaurants in the lobby. The views of the water and the city skyline are fantastic.
