I was visiting my son in Chicago. I loved staying at W. Personnel was very friendly and helpful. Location was great! Rooms were clean and cozy. Bathroom was small but I did not need a lot of counter space and it did not bother us. They could use firmer pillows though but it was not a problem because I stayed there only for 3 nights.

There are lots of great hotel choices in Chicago.  This is not one of them.  The room needed renovation.  When we turned on the air conditioner, it banged loudly.  When we asked to be moved to a quiet room, we were told that we would have to pay more.  We paid hundreds of dollars for four hours sleep.  We won' t be back.

Later found out that they tried to charge us for an umbrella that they loaned us, and which we returned.  AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!!

A modern hotel has been placed into an older building. In the lobby this means an Asian fusion restaurant has spilled over. In the elevators a cool blue hue and holographic bubbles. The old bones show once you leave the lobby and you can see where the fresh coats of paint attempt to obscure. The room is a modern wonderland of chic white cabinets, over priced mini bars, and a shadow box illuminating an inspirational quote to help you sleep.

 I'm no world traveler, but I don't know why there have been bad reviews of this hotel. Great customer service from the reservation, to the front desk, to the room service, to the cleaning staff. Stylish rooms and lobby. Comfortable bed. Fantastic towels. The best hotel gym I've seen. Great food. I got an amazing deal on the room. Overall wonderful experience. Would totally stay again!!

Really disappointed with my stay. The W in general has lost its lustre. Small room, tiny bathroom, and not enough staff at check-in and check-out. Room service was late and the order was wrong. During check-in, another customer was given a room, that already had someone in it, and the staff was insanely unhelpful, ending in a shouting match. On top of all this? Expensive. Will not stay again.
