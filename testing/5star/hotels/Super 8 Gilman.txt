we arrived in the twilight of the evening. The place looks good both inside and outside. Only met one staff member, who was very pleasant, and quickly got us our room. Very clean room, including the shower area. Breakfast was good. Would stay again if in the area.

Not a place to get a good night's sleep.  Trains run nearby throughout the night and will wake you up at all hours.  On the positive side, there is a Waffle House nearby if you need coffee or a meal.

Very nice rooms at a reasonable rate. Excellent location near food and fuel. Good air conditioning. My only complaint is the small bathroom.

Reserved room through Wyndham rewards. Check in was quick and easy. The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, pleasant, and helpful. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and spacious enough for a king bed with micro and fridge. Bathroom was clean and spacious enough. Wifi worked well. Entry to our room could be obtained from the parking lot and an inner hall depending on what door we chose to use. Very satisfied. Would stay again.
