This Hampton Inn was in a great location! There were many food and shopping options in the area. The staff was very friendly and was able to accommodate us quickly. Our room was spacious and very clean, and the free WiFi was great. My daughter loves swimming in the indoor pool, I just wish it would have been heated as well as being indoor. The continental breakfast had many optuons: cereal, pastries, eggs, sausage, waffles, just to name a few. If I'm ever in Matteson, IL again, I would definitely consider staying there again.

The hotel hadr been recently renovated and looks very nice and clean. The free breakfast is a pretty good quality - normal stuff you'd expect eggs/omelets, pastries, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, sausage/bacon, etc. My room was fairly decent, I'm not a bit fan of the A/C units, but it work well so I can't complain. The bathroom and shower are nice. My biggest issue is that there was no closet in the room, only a chest of drawers, so there was nowhere to hang my nice clothes.

I've stayed here before. It's in a useful location.. near the interstate and in walking distance to ample shopping and restaurants. Great place for less than a hundred bucks a night. Free WiFi too.

The newly renovated hotel was really nice! The rooms and the lobby all had an updated modern feel to it, which was very welcoming. Also the staff was friendly and helpful.

Serviceable hotel. Nothing fancy, but staff are generally always very friendly. Breakfast is generally better than standard Hamptons. Pro Tip: If you can finagle an upgrade, the Studio Suites are nice.
