The hotel is nice enough. Pricey....way pricey, but probably because of the MLB playoffs...no problems with the room. There is a workout room and a pool/hot tub. Breakfast is pretty standard and does  not vary from day to day. The staff is nice. All in all though, a pleasant experience.

Good City Hotel when you want some extra room.  Entrance is on the 4th floor.  Remodeled lobby and breakfast area.  A couple of blocks away from Michigan, a little more quiet. Breakfast included. Parking is $65 per day.Lots of great restaurants within walking distance.

Great place just north of the river. Close to the lively nightlife. Comfortable bed, kitchenette, full fridge and microwave in our room. Full continental breakfast included with our stay with good selection available. Amazing staff that was helpful and friendly. 

The only con I have is the separate elevator from ground level to lobby then a separate elevator to either Residence Inn and Springhill Suites (combined lobby)

It was a very nice stay. The handicap room we had was supposed to be a self opening door, but it didn't work and the mechanism on the door is very heavy to open. Thankfully we didn't need it, it was just the room we were given. It was close to a lot of fun places to dine and walk around. The breakfast was great and Veronica was hilarious.

I've stayed here more than any other place in Chicago, and the reason is the suites. Great for a family with children - the adults can get the bedroom and the kid(s) get the hideway bed. Small kitchen to store your own leftovers.

The breakfasts have been nice. The friendly Eastern European lady is super friendly. The rest of the staff has been excellent. We had an issue one time with loud guests causing problems the hallway of our floor, and by morning the people were out of the hotel. Nice to see employees taking issues like that seriously.
