Fantastic value for a prime location in Chicago. Walking distance to many major attractions and the inside was recently renovated. Nice clean carpets, new paint and comfy beds. Exterior still looks old and is in early stages on updates. Was not disturbed by noise and the staff especially the concierge were very nice. If you want a clean comfy spot in the heart of the city and don't want to bust your budget I would recommend a stay.

Love this hotel.  Will stay no where else in Chicago. Check in and check out was so easy.  Price for in the city was great.  Staff is awesome.  Allowed early check in and held our bags after check out so we could enjoy almost two full extra days in the city.  Pool was great.  View from pool was awesome.  Room service available, quick and fast and good.  Staff is willing to help and give directions to where ever you needed to go. Suite was huge, bed was comfy.  Housekeeping was great.  Just an overall great experience.  A++

The hotel was clean and updated.  The staff was great. They went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant.  The parking attendants were so nice.  They gave us directions and ideas.  The hotel restaurant had good food and service.  Definitely recommend!

Hotel is being renovated on the outside, the inside is finished and is very fresh and clean. The location is great. The service was very good. There is no breakfast included with your stay which is disappointing for a best Western, but that is typical for big city downtown hotels. I would stay here again if i get back to Chicago

Stayed here over the weekend of the Chicago Marathon.  Overall the hotel is in a good location, and the room was fine (only complaint was that the A/C was super-noisy).  Our main issue is that the hotel was really difficult to navigate with a one-year old and a stroller.  Seemingly the only way to get into the lobby/check-in area is to go through a double doorway (that doesn't stay open) and up a short flight of stairs.  It may not have been a big deal if we weren't in and out a bunch over the weekend between Marathon events and seeing the sites in town. 
 We've traveled all over the world and this is probably the most inaccessible hotel we've ever been to.  In addition, we had an issue with parking, and lack of ice in the machines (which were difficult to find), and quite a lot of city noise (which we expect) -otherwise our stay was mostly uneventful.
