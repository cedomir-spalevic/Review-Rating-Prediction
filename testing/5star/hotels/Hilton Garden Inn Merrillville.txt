Took my family of 5 to stay at the Hilton Garden IN to go to the Deep River Water Park! Everyone we came in contact with so polite, friendly, and genuine good people! Not only did they make sure our stay was awesome, they went of their way to talk to us and our family. The people at reception and the ladies we came in contact with during breakfast were absolutely wonderful! Made our experience a great one! Will definitely come back!!

Lacks professionalism in a big way. A guy told us he would pay for our rooms. The staff seemed upset about it. The help walked passed me and said out loud you guys are idiots for believing a complete stranger would cover your rooms. We sure made an ass out of her because he paid for all of our rooms in full. We were truly blessed by this gentlemen. He said he thinks they are giving us such a hard time because we are people of color and he would no longer do business with them. He was thinking about doing some sort of campaign with them and said forget about it.

Very clean with friendly and helpful staff.  Was there for a 2 day meeting where the hotel catered the lunches which were very well done with nice presentation.  Good breakfast and friendly bar.
