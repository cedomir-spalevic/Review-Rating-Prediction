Where do I begin with this place! They are amazing from the front desk to every staff member in the place. I teach Knock your socks off customer training classes and I would think they had my class lol. Anyway this is the best place to stay in Merrillville, IN. They made my trip so much more enjoyable. Clean, Caring, the warm cookies, good breakfast, and they have fresh water for you all night with lime. If you stay here you will not be disappointed. Oh don't let me forget the heated pool! Thanks again Fairfield Team!

Fairfield Inn was easily located right off the highway in an area with a lot of restaurants, gas stations, shopping, and other big city feels in a small town environment. We were traveling as a family for a professional event in the area. We felt it was safe and family friendly. The service was quick and friendly. The room was newly renovated and comfortable. Our room had two full size beds which are smaller than what we are used to (we have usually seen queens). For our little family it worked fine. The breakfast was nice and included hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, fruit, cereal, waffles, yogurt, assorted drinks, and a coffee bar. There is an outside pool, however it wasn't open yet, but we stayed the first weekend in June and the weather hadn't been warm enough. Nice, clean place. Would stay again if in the area.

Room was clean, great service, and large Continental breakfast. We did have several problems with our room, including a broken toilet and telephone. Staff was very helpful and professional and even gave us a discount on the room.

You get a family style warm welcome with a big smile. Conveniently next to the freeway, it is clean and big enough for that stop after a long day on the road. Nice pool if you still have the energy.
