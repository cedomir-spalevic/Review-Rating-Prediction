Nice, comfy and clean. Guest services was professional and polite. Good spread for comp breakfast. Easy access to shopping, dining, etc. Just bring your earplugs if you're not used to sleeping in the city- some nights can be a little loud outside!

We traveled to Chicago for a mini getaway from 8/09/17 - 8/11/17.  Although we've stayed in many luxurious 5 star hotels, Hampton Inn never disappoints and Chicago-Downtown was no exception. The front desk and housekeeping staff were amazing and our king suite was lovely.  If you're willing to sacrifice a skyline or water view, then I highly recommend this hotel. The amenities and comfort make up for the view.

Rooms are comfy and clean. Complimentary breakfast is not great. Hotel staff is friendly. We got there early and they checked our baggage and said they would call us when the room was ready. Never called but when we went back at check in time our room was ready.

Location was right around everything. Uber in and out or walked with my kids. Service was friendly and the breakfast was good. They have a decent workout room and a nice pool with sauna. We would stay again.
