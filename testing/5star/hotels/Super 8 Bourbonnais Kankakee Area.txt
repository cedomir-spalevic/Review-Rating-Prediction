Don't know personally about the motel itself, so I won't say much, but just thought I'd mention there's no elevator. Had family members visiting the area (one of which is in a wheelchair) and reserved a room on the second floor expecting there to be an elevator. Unfortunately there was no way to get the wheelchair up the stairs. Had to find a room at a different hotel as the main floor was full. The staff was great and didn't charge for the room and were helpful, but anyone needing a walker or wheelchair needs to realize they HAVE to get a room on the main floor. Hope this helps someone in their planning!

It's a place to stay and sleep. I wouldn't call it nice, exactly. Local weirdos staying here. Cops banging on door woke me up due to halucinating dope head claiming gangs were after him banging on doors. Woman raising hell in lobby over lost cigarettes.. It's also kinda dirty. But, it's better than other offerings nearby. Staff are nice folks.
