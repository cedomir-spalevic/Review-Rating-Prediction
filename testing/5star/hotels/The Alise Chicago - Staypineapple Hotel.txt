We had a fantastic stay at The Alise. Came on a weeknight and paid less than $200 for the room and overnight valet parking, which isn't terrible considering the location. It was within walking distance to all the spots we needed. The staff was incredible and the room (although small) was comfortable. The individual duvets on the bed were a nice touch, it may be the best I've ever slept (and yes, we are now going to adapt the 2-duvets 1-bed style). My only complaint was the bathroom facilities could use some maintenance/updating. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay at The Alise immensely and will be staying there again.

The hotel was very nice! Fantastic views of the city, very clean rooms and a friendly staff. We did have issues with a package we ordered (my girlfriend paid to have beer on ice upon our arrival, and it was not there and we had to remind them several times to bring it up). However, they provided the package free of charge for the trouble. Very good service! I would recommend this hotel for anyway who wants to stay in the heart of Chicago.

Staying at the Alise was a great experience! Love the view of State Street and lake Michigan from our room. Beds are super comfy. The bathroom and everything else is clean. We bought a package that included parking and it's been extremely convenient

If you're looking for a super cute hotel with a friendly staff and an amazing location, this is it! I love Stay Pineapple locations. They make their customers feel valued. Also, it helps that the hotels are super comfy and very cute inside.

Great historic architecture and architectural accents, friendly and accommodating service, convenient location to downtown attractions. We really enjoyed our overnight. The rooms and common areas have held onto some interesting design elements of the building's past. Room was very clean. The bikes were a fun extra, I just wished that had an assortment of frame sizes. We will definitely be back.
