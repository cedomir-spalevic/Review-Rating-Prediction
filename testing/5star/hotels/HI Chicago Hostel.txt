I  was traveling to Chicago on a budget and stayed at this AWESOME Hostel for 4 nights and a day in late July. I had a wonderful time during my stay. With it located on Congress downtown I was able to safely walk or take the Chicago public transportation system to all of my daily excursions. The rooms are very nice and clean that connect with a kitchen and bathroom/shower. The rec area (pool tables and lounge) was great to sit down in after a long day and relax. The breakfast was good although not more than a few small pastries, cereal, fruit, bagels and toast. Check in front desk and employees were very helpful with questions and needs. Overall a very nice and enjoyable experience at the Hi Chicago Hostel. When I can get back to Chicago this will be my first place to make a reservation.

Very affordable, clean rooms and bathrooms, friendly and helpful staff, and the location is perfect. It's next to shopping and theatres  on State Street, several different train stations and a couple blocks from Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain. The Greyhound bus Station is only about 7-8 blocks away or $7 cab ride. Union Station is also close by, within walking distance. Blues legend Buddy Guy's cafe/blues club is only a couple blocks away. I will definitely be coming back!

If you're looking for a nice quaint little hotel, this is not the place. It's probably more comparable to a dorm mixed with a camp. But if you're traveling in a large enough group that you can put 8 people of the same gender into a room, it's pretty nice. For the price, it's a great place. Pretty clean, conveniently located, complimentary breakfast, etc.

Very welcoming & helpful. Check-in time is a bit on the late side (4pm). But location is AMAZING. Beds & rooms were clean. Free access to a full kitchen & other commodities on the 2nd floor. Truly cannot get a better located hotel for the price! Will visit again

HI Chicago was an amazing hostel to stay at. It was right down the block from the beautiful Melenium Park. I was with a group of 14 and all of us could comfortably stay in 1 room and the service was really nice as well. On the second floor for occupants was a lounge area with pool tables, a ping pong table and couches and chairs if you just want to relax with a T.V. in the back
