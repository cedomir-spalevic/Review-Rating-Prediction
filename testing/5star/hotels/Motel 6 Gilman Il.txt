Gilman is a very small town and we stayed there when we attended a country concert at the Ford County Fair about 20 miles away.  The motel was fine.  Nothing too fancy but for the price it was okay.  It is very close to eating establishments and the check in was easy and the hotel personnel was friendly.  I think the room could have been a little cleaner for my taste, but the bed was comfortable.

I stay here whenever I come home. There is reason I do, they are always so very accomodating. I like the look and feel of the rooms. They have the sweetest staff.  Always awesome!!! I cannot rave enough about them.

I stay at motel 6 almost every weekend, and I've never had any serious issues. The first thing I noticed was the stale smell to the room. The bath towels were very yellow and paper thin, dead bugs on the floor, two moldy coffee cups in the microwave, when the vent is running in the bathroom ; it made the room smell like sewage.  The floors were so dirty my feet were black. Okay, so I go in and clean (because obviously they don't) next thing, my dog starts breaking out in hives. So, I go out and get some benadryl as my husband gives him a bath. Guess what? Dog is covered in fleas. My dog is 9, and has had one flea in his life.  I sat there and picked the fleas off, one by one and killed them. Tv channels are very slim pickings. You have a better chance of finding a channel selling sex toys (yes, it's true), than a news channel, or anything of decency for a family. 

Positives: the washer and dryer were very good (not taking fleas with me)

Microwave and refrigerator in room

Never saw any live bugs on floor, besides a spider.

Close to McDonald's,  burger king, dairy queen and truck stops

Quiet for the most part, but walls are paper thin.
