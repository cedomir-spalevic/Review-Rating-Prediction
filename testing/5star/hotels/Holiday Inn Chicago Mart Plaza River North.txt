Beautiful hotel in the heart of the city, surrounded by the Chicago river. Always have a rough time finding in with google maps but once we are there we don't take our car out again. Only $40 for 24 hour parking. 6 blocks to the train or cabs waiting right the the doorstep. Nice bar area & restaurant in the hotel. Have not tried the indoor pool but looks great with a dome over the top. Rooms are clean and beds are super comfy. Cannot beat the views! Have stayed here 2x in past month and plan to again in August.

We we're at this hotel for a tech conference. Though it is a bit odd with the lobby being on the 15th floor, the staff made it easy to understand. From the bellmen on the street to the reception staff everyone was kind and helpful. The views from my room we're spectacular, and the room itself comfortable. Great experience

4 stars, because the staff is amazing, otherwise would be three stars. Room(s), at least my room needs a visit from maintenance. No, I didnt request maintenance, because it is still functional. Wall paper near ac/heater peeling, ac/heater really dusty (inside where you can see fan blades and what not) showerhead leaks around the fitting, so light water stream with a cascade off the back side where fitting is leaking. Did I say the staff was amazing? From the bell hop, concierge and front desk, to the folks serving food, everyone is very friendly and energetic. It was truly refreshing.

Beautiful hotel (especially the lobby) in a great location. The Navy Pier was about a 35-50 minute walk, Millennium Park slightly less, and there were several great restaurants nearby. The staff was very friendly and we were able to check-in to our rooms way earlier than expected. The room itself was clean and the sound proofing seemed to be adequate as I did not hear any sounds from other guests.

View of the river and the city from our room is exceptional. The staff responds to issues promptly. The location is a good walking distance to the river and ride share programs have no issues finding us. Very courteous staff.
