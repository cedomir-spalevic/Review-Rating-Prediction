Nice rooms. Good accommodations. Friendly staff. The one downside is that we ordered a projector for a meeting that we had booked here and the projector never showed up. We were told that they would have to get a hold of the audiovisual company and that we shouldâ€™ve told them ahead of time. We had told them ahead aof time and we received the cart with all the cords for the projector but no projector.

Beds are comfy, front desk clerk was super friendly and nice.. the fridge in our room wasn't working when we arrived, but they switched it out fairly quick. The window in our room leaked very bad and soaked the curtains and floor from a rain shower..

Very clean room, more space than any other king suite I've visited in this price range.  Also very quiet. You couldn't hear any of the normal hotel noise such as people in the hallways, doors closing,  water running from other rooms, etc.  Staff are very friendly and accommodating.

The only con was the included continental breakfast. It was very basic. Scrambled eggs, sausage, waffle maker, yogurt, 3 different fresh fruits (apples, oranges, and alternating days cantaloupe/honeydew), select pastries (fresh but tasted like store bought), coffee and juice machines. 

But considering all of the other benefits and it's at least $25 less per day than anything comparable in the area, you can have breakfast at one of the many local restaurants in the area for the price difference if you're so inclined.

Definitely will stay here again the next time we visit the area.

The hotel itself was acceptable and the staff were friendly and accomodating, but the rooms seemed inadequately maintained. Overall a decent enough stay, but I would not recommend it to friends or family.
