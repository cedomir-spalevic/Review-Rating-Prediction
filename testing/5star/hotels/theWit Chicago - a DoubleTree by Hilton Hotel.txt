Great hotel.  You cannot beat proximity to downtown attractions and the train, especially for the price.  The staff here were extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and more than accommodation.  I booked through a 3rd party website, and the website screwed up my reservation, but the gentleman at the front desk was nice enough to let me check in at 4 AM the morning of my reservation.  Will definitely be staying here again.

The room my husband and I stayed in was fairly large with a decent view of the city. You could also see parts of the navy pier. I was not a big fan of the valet charge but we only stayed for the night. They were very accommodating. We were able to check in about two hours early which was a big relief after a long drive.

Parking is $65 valet off site so save yourself $20 and park just next door in the ramp for $45 and you can go back to your vehicle if you forgot something in the car.  Hotel staff was very nice.  We were traveling with two minors and a sitter; the rooftop bar was recommended to us as 'kid friendly' but we stopped up to check it out and in the nicest possible way the staff steered is elsewhere.  Walked to the nearby Elephant and Castle and had a nice dinner.

It was really nice. My childhood friend was married on the roof and had his reception in a hall on the third floor. It was pretty upscale but not stuffy. The staff was very friendly. The food was very good, but the dessert was spectacular. It was a nice and ample spread both on the roof and at the reception. Also, the roof is an exclusive nightclub in the evening. The women in line were gorgeous!! There's a lot to see on the streets around the wit. It's right next to that famous CHICAGO sign from the intro of Perfect Strangers. I heard the rooms were nice, but I was super distracted. I had been ditched at dinner by some of my best friends and they felt no need to apologise. It's been tearing up inside. I know they were happy with their stay. Oh, and the concierge will tell you the cheapest and best lot to park at. It's on Randolph and State. Very useful information.

This place was awesome. The staff made incredible efforts to help us with directions around the town. They text me to ensure everything was good. Just really good service and location.
