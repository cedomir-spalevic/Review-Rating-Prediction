Checked it out for a visit next year & was given a tour.  Looks like a fun place to visit.  Staff & campers were very friendly.

 This is a great place for clothing optional. Owners as great,  everyone is friendly,  great pool, can't find anything bad too day about the place.  Beware though, once you go there you will love the place and want to be there all the time. They have dances every weekend and other activities throughout the year. See you there.

How could you not love this place? Just left there for the first time, and let me just say I'LL BE BACK! Everyone should try this out. A big thank you to the staff.
