Perfect location to be in the middle of Downtown. Great service by guest services and reception AND maintenance. Alma, Adrian and Max were great.

Overall, we had a pleasant and comfortable stay at this hotel. The location is good, downtown, just a street off the Magnificent Mile. The room was clean and with a modern decor. The kids enjoyed the pool. I knocked off and star for the staff at the reception when we arrived; very rude and not welcoming. Oh, our room was equipped with a fridge and microwave, which was convenient for keeping a few snacks.

We were welcomed by a kind front desk clerk when we arrived who was helpful in explaining all the hotel's amenities. Our room was a standard room with two double beds. The room had a fridge and microwave along with a single serve coffee maker. Everything was clean and comfortable. The location was great--very walkable. We enjoyed our stay. I was especially impressed with the cleaning staff, who always greeted us with smiles and "have a great day today!" as we passed them in the halls. Will stay here again.

The room was nice and we had a good view. Everything was within walking distance. When we booked the room through southwest it said the room included breakfast. Once we got here we were told it was not included. The hot tub on the 12th floor also did not work.
