The rooms are comfortable. And have huge glass showers. Nice when you are a big guy. The free breakfast was good.

the room was average in size however the bldg had the ac running all night and it was only 60 degrees outside and the heater in the room looks like the very first hotel heater ever made and on low will have you breaking into a sweat in seconds don regulating the temperature was a challenge I couldn't surpass in a day. The bathroom was tiny and the shower was een tinier I kept bumping into the walls and I'm 5'3" so I'm not sure what someone of average or larger proportions would do. The tv was new but rather small. Overall, for the price it wasn't bad but I wouldn't recommend for a comfortable extended stay.
