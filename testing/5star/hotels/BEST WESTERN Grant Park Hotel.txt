We enjoyed a lake view room for one night at the Best Western, and had a great stay. Our lake view was truly that, overlooking Grant Park and the lake. The staff were friendly during check in, the room was clean, and the hotel looks recently remodeled. Comfy bed, big bathroom, great water pressure, etc. Comfortable and got a good night's rest. Did not use their parking or restaurant.

The price for the room was excellent until we were told that parking would be an added $52.00. There was a parking lot about half a block away that cost half that price. We had a few questions for the women working at the front desk and they weren't the friendliest when answering them. The entrance was nice though and a different staff member was quick to hold the door for us on multiple occasions. The rooms were a little outdated, our bed was very squeaky and the bathroom was a little small. The proximity to Grant Park, shopping, restaurants and the red-line train were unbeatable though!

Nice guy at the desk. Even tho he couldn't help me, he tried. Which made me happy. Very pretty. Could use more color to be honest.

The location of Best Western Grant Park is unbeatable. We were visiting for the night for Taste of Chicago and arrived a little earlier that check-in time but still got to our room immediately. In the morning, the valet locked our bags in a storage room when we checked out and we were able to pick them up whenever we needed. The room was clean and fresh and had a nice view. It was a wonderful room for the night - definitely will stay here again in the future.
