$50/night valet mandated parking or $40/trip at the nearest lot...so we were told (didn't confirm) was a bit steep imo. The valet were prompt, cordial, and available 24hrs.

The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size and clean as well. We had a corner room which overlooked the parking lot and forced us to keep our blinds closed or give the neighbors an easy view. 

The business room was quaint, but easily accessible and quiet. 

They have a shuttle service and the driver was great. Very personable and altered his route to bring us closer to our location (it was raining). 

Ultimately, I would book this location again, although I would probably skip bringing my car there.

First and foremost, my biggest piece of advice if you stay at this hotel is to call the local police if there is illegal drug activity and audible violent altercations on your floor.  We called security 3 times to address this exact situation as we tried to get sleep for our sick loved one in the hospital across the street.  Nothing happened, so if you'd like something done and you'd like to sleep, call the local police.

Second, expect a lack of flexibility, empathy, and respect from most of the front desk employees/managers.  If you'd interested in an absence of security for your physical safety but an abundance of security for your Marriotts rewards points, this is the place for you.  

One plus- the bartenders were very kind.

Super nice staff, not a bad location, and really good food all around. Hotel is really nice and clean. Overnight parking is pretty expensive, that's the only complaint I have. I would recommend this hotel

If you are attending an event at the United Center this is the perfect place to stay. They offer free shuttle service to and from the event. 
The hotel was nice either a large bathroom. The breakfast was very good but a little pricy but that may be typical for the city I'm not sure. I would stay here again if going to the United Center.

This is a fabulous place to stay, especially if you have business at Rush or Stoger Hospitals. Its across the street from Rush and only a couple blocks from Stoger. The rooms are clean, have lots of sunlight (at least mine did), comfortable beds, lots of pillows, small refrigerators, and plenty of hot water. The staff is free with smiles and very friendly. They did their best to accommodate my needs, I had only to ask! They offer a free shuttle to take you wherever you would like to go, within a mile distance from the hotel. The shuttle driver, Lucas, knows all the great spots to eat! See him for suggestions! I would definitely stay again!
