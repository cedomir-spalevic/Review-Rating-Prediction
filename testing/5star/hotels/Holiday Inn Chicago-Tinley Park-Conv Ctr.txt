Holiday Inn Chicago Tinley Park Convention Center was very easy to find from Interstate 80. Holiday Inn had attractive comfortable rooms. The rooms were a very quick walk to the Convention Center. The Convention Center itself was laid out very sensibly and individual rooms were easy to locate. Parking was free and convenient. I would definitely attend a conference here again.

A wonderful time for  sure. This particular Holiday Inn is more upscale than what you might be expecting from a Holiday Inn. The food for breakfast and in the lounge was fabulous, housekeeping was on point & everyone was very polite. It's a very nice place to stay we'll stay every time we're anywhere near.

Rooms are very clean and bed are comfortable. The workers here are polite and were  very nice to me and my family for the three days we spent here. Breakfast was just perfect.Would highly recommend.

Not bad, staff are friendly and accommodating. Your only real option for anything at the convention center. Restaurant us unimpressive.

The hotel was adequate with a restaurant called Bananas. We tried to get a drink at the bar at 11:45 p.m. but was told it was last call so had to drink quickly. Bartender told another patron that it was closed and it was only 11:55. Close to Hollywood casino amphitheater. Did not use their restaurant.
