The rooms are adequate, but small. The hotel is in need of an upgrade and their is no elevator. The swimming pool was clean and tidy. The breakfast definitely left something to be desired, there were very few choices which made accommodating allergies difficult. My family and I visit this area several times a year and most likely will not return to this hotel.

Beds were stiff. Sheets were stained. Room had a strong chemical smell from the cheap cleaner. But overall it was fine. Hot shower, AC worked, continental breakfast was decent. Cheap hotel.

The room'a heat was on when I arrived. It's August. Took quite awhile to cool off, but slept well when it finally was cool. The free Continental breakfast was underwhelming.

Easily accessible from interstate. The rooms on back side of building are facing I57, but I didn't notice the sound. Nice room for over night. Cable had Food Network. I did not notice the free WiFi network, but didn't bother me as I just tetheredâ€‹ to my phone. Good enough breakfast, including make your own waffles.
