Staff was friendly, professional and quick. Gym was nice, full of machines, and clean. Wish the rooms had refrigerators instead of coolers although there is an option to call and have the service provided for a refrigerator, but i did not want to put forth the effort. Walking bridge to the convention center is perfect. Room service always came earlier than estimated (a plus when you're hungry). Enjoyed my stay.

This is a great hotel if you're in town for a conference at the McCormick center. The hotel is directly across the street from the center. The rooms are spacious and the staff is very accommodating. You're a short ride from downtown and there are many options for food in the area. I would definitely stay here again.

My wife and I stayed here for a no-kids date night. The room was large, with a king bed and a beautiful view of the city. Most important, it was clean and comfortable. Breakfast at the Hotel's Third Star restaurant was excellent. We had a fantastic time and would recommend Hyatt Regency McCormick to anyone staying downtown.

Excellent facilities with several options for food within the hotel. We liked the market. However, the lines are long in the morning. Rooms are well appointed, clean and safe. Hotel overlooks lake Michigan and is very lovely. Be aware there is very little in the immediate vicinity of the hotel so you will need to uber or taxi to other restaurants. Staff very friendly and attentive.

We were amazed coming into the lobby with the scale and quality of the environment. The staff are very professional and kind as well as very thorough. The room itself was very clean and upscale. I especially liked the curved desk provided with two chairs as it allowed us to focus on our work instead of one of us working while sitting in the bed. The large glass shower stall was incredible along with the rest of the bathroom. There was ample room around the sink for our personal hygiene products. We were very impressed by the recreation center. Not only were the appearance of the machines modern and sleek, they worked very smoothly. The pool was two lanes with enough seating.
