You know the old saying, "well, I've stayed in worse places..."? THIS is the place they were talking about! The rooms and the sheets were nasty and the hotel does not attract a good clientele. Pay a little more and pick a hotel where safety isn't an issue.

Checked in at 7:30, dropped stuff of in room 132 and went and got a sandwich. Came back at 8:25 and spent about 3 minutes in the room and had fleas jumping on my legs.  Grab my stuff and went to front desk to tell her I was not staying there due to the fleas. She told me I've been checked in almost an hour so they couldn't refund my stay. I left anyways. Dirty, disgusting, unfriendly...stay in your car instead.
