This is a great hotel in the middle of everything! There's a nice sitting area downstairs off the lobby, a fun and modern bar/restaurant, and a nice outdoor pool with a running track around it! We stayed in a king bedroom with a balcony which was great. The floor in our room was pretty! The bed was comfortable, ample enough TV channels, a nice desk, a comfortable chair, and an ottoman. The bathroom was interesting, there were two sliding doors - one to enter the bathroom and one to enter either the shower or the toilet (it rolled back and forth between the two). 

I highly recommend asking the concierge any questions you have about the area. They were so helpful! The front desk was also helpful in anything we needed for our room!

We were celebrating my birthday in Chicago, so my boyfriend called down to ask if they had a slice of cake with a candle for a birthday...they said they didn't have a slice of cake but had something similar. Within 5 minutes, they came up with this beautiful small dessert with a candle and a happy birthday message on the plate. It was delicious!

I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely look forward to another stay. Thanks for making my birthday fun, exciting, and comfortable!

All of the staff members are delightful and helpful. The rooms are pretty and spacious. I love the shower head that's pointed straight down so it's similar to rain. The rates are incredibly fair considering the quality. I didn't use the indoor pool and hot tub but the outdoor pool, child pool, and hot tub are amazing. I recommend staying here if you ever need a hotel in this area!

I really enjoyed my time at the Radisson Blu. I was attending as a speaker at a conference at the hotel and was very impressed with every staff member that I encountered from the bellboys at the taxi stand all the way to the waiters and waitresses serving dinner at the event. I was also impressed with the catering around the event and the restaurant in the hotel which I believe is called Fellini's. On top of it all the architecture of the hotel is spectacular and the location perfect.

Beautiful hotel. Nice amenities staff was nice. Valet guy was a little unforgiving with me considering Im a bus driver picking up my group. Not many places to park a full sized motor coach. He even complained about the engine running while I was actively loading passenger's. This guy is no reflection on the facilities and the rest of the staff. Every other staff member gave service with a smile!

The hotel is beautiful and nicely located, but we were treated very poorly by the manager. My group of girlfriends and I were kicked out of our hotel at 1am with no place to go for a simple noise complaint. We did not have any music on, we were simply returning from a night out and talking. They did not have the courtesy to call us and ask us to be quiet. A simple phone call to let us know would have been sufficient, but they felt the need to treat respectful, paying customers like criminals. I will never stay here again and I highly recommend looking elsewhere if you would like to enjoy your time in Chicago.
