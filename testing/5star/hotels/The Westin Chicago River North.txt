Fantastic hotel, fantastic view, fantastic room!! Love it, I got a corner unit that give me a great view of the river, super cool! The check in staff was friendly. Hotel even has an executive lounge for platinum members which is rare in Westin. Convenient to a lot of local stuff and close to the business district as well. Will definitely recommend and come back.

Checked in for our one year anniversary. Staff was very courteous. Hotel was clean and we'll maintained. River view is at an angle, but nice. Pillows are all very soft and none were even close to firm. Valet is $62 per night, but there isn't too much parking around there.

I don't know how a hotel that charges more offers less. No complimentary wifi. Happy hour drink prices are double what a restaurant charges for top shelf drinks. Room was clean and spacious. Toilet ran all night.

One of my favorite hotels. Classic style on the river. Bar is great with happy hour and sushi restaurant in lobby. Entrance is opposite the river on the north side of the building

Great hotel and will definitely stay here again. The hotel is very modern and all areas are clean and well maintained. Staff are excellent and very helpful. They even have New Balance gym kits you can hire for $5 which include trainers, socks, shorts and a t-shirt which was very useful since our luggage was delayed by the airline for >24 hours.
