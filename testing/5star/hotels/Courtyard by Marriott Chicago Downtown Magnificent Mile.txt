Wonderful hotel and even better location.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  We had a  king room with fold out couch.  The couch was twin size and we were expecting at least a double.  My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   Pool was small but nice.  I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!

I was there for a training for work.  The customer service is wonderful.  They took extra time to help my co-worker and I store our luggage and seamlessly recognized us when it was time to pick it back up. The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. I will definitely be staying there again soon.

Fantastic view, very conscientious staff. Room was missing the tv remote and maintenance was sent up with a new one immediately. He was also very friendly and helpful. Price was very reasonable for the downtown location. Pool was small if you are planning on swimming.

Feedback shared by our VitalSmarts facilitator at our Crucial Conversations program in October:  
"Everyone commented on how good the food was an how amazing the staff is – Pete, Danny, Edith, and Rose were phenomenal as usual. They were so sweet too – I mentioned that it would be nice to stay in the same room if possible, due to needing to run out to a funeral in between days and they confirmed it was okay, and they sent me some flowers with a very nice message and card – it seriously made my day!"

The hotel was right in the middle of the action of the magnificent mile. The price was average of what you'll find in the area. The front desk agents were helpful and accommodating to everything we needed. 

The hotel has a Starbucks, a full restaurant (with bar), and a small pantry/market on the main floor. Would absolutely recommend and consider again next time I'm in town.
