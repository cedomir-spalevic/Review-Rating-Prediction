This is one of the BEST HOTELS with GREAT EMPLOYEES! Itâ€™s affordable and a nice getaway for families with children. They have a pool and really nice suites that can cater to larger families. They offer a decent breakfast in the morning. Plenty of nice restaurants in the area, and very close to the freeway.

The Comfort Inn in Salt Lake City was an amazing experience. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. I have had bad experiences with other hotels, but I've never had a problem with this place!

Comfortable! Good water pressure, decent breakfast, average pool, nice staff. Tv's are very irritating to operate. You have to be in exactly the right position to use the remote and the buttons on the tv can't be used. Beds are comfortable, and the room included a microwave and a mini fridge. Overall, we're happy with our stay. The only issue we had were the room keys. I heard two other guests (different parties) complain about this too. The cards lose magnetization very easily. We had to get ours remade after less than 24 hours and the side entrances don't always work either. The staff described them as "hit or miss" Overall, we're happy with our stay!
