My friend and I visited Chicago to tour a film school, and when researching hotels before our trip we found Chinatown Hotel to meet all our requirements while still being quite cheap. When we arrived we were not disappointed, everything was what we expected or better and the location of the hotel was perfect too. 5/5 would recommend.

Decent location. Easy access to trains and only a few stops from downtown. Rooms were outdated, had very few features (TV with a couple of channels and A/C) and far from cozy. The building is older so there is no elevator, which after a long day of walking was rough. I would stay there again if I couldn't find a deal downtown again.

Great place to stay. The rooms are small. If you are looking to stay in your room for your entire visit them it might be a problem. Otherwise its close to lots of things. The room was clean and bathroom clean. There is no elevator so if you are on the 3 rd floor its 3 flights of stairs. The staff is very nice and helpful.

Cheap and affordable. Great location in heart of Chinatown with close proximity to public transportation. Very basic amenities but helpful and friendly staff.

So far so good. Clean. The room, as most of China Town, smells a little musty. But that's the entire area really. The experience of staying in China Town is worth the smaller rooms and must smell. Plus, we're spending most our time in Chicago. Not in a hotel room. If you want a 5 star hotel, this isn't it, if you want a decent room, for a good price, stay here. TV sucks though. I think it's that free TV, and it keeps going out. 4 stars only because of the TV. If they had cable it would have 5 stars.
