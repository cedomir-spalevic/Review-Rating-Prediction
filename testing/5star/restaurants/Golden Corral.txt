Very nice staff, horrible food, horrible mess! Loud place. The food was cheap, the cheese tasted like plastic! Food all over the floor, I stepped in shrimp and a few other things. There's no way with all these people they can keep the place clean. I felt like I was risking food poisoning eating here, and I was kind of nervous about that. Thankfully I didn't get sick. Kids running wild (ghetto as hell) I only ate a couple things here. Had to come here for a party. YUCKKKKK

Our server was wonderful. She was super kind and helpful. On the other hand a lot of the food trays were empty. The bathroom had pee on the seats and floor. Lunch buffet was 9.39 per adult, which was a great price. I was hoping for more fresh food though.

Went on a Sunday night with a large group. Had to wait a minute for seating, but employees were courteous and helpful in finding a suitable table as well as a high chair. Food was all hot and fresh. Restaurant was very busy, but all in all a good experience.

I like most of the food here. And will eat here again. Have never seen anything unsanitary until this time. I saw one of the cooks knock a container off of the prep table and pick it up and put it back on the prep table. Later she used it to put good in. Potatoe salad, cold slaw or blue cheese dressing or something like that. I should have reported it at that time but I didn't.
