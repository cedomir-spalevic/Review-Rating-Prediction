Did not want to even give 1 star and dont get me wrong i like there pizza but there customer service sucks. I placed a order they said about 40 minutes so after a hr and my kids starving i called they could not find my house and the number did not work.  I live on grand in Bradley now your store is in Bradley and you deliver pizza every day so ya i was mad and got a little sh!! With them so they hung up on me. If you cant handle a mad customer then you shouldn't be working there.  So i called back and got switch to 3 different people just to tell they bring it to me.  So now its not fresh and probably cold. So told them i will get my pizza from someone else. Called pizza hut and they had my pizza here in 25 minutes with no problems and there store is not even in Bradley

This place is horrible I ordered a pizza and waited an hour for delivery, called and they said driver was coming! Half hour later we call again and they say they are not sending us the pizza because driver went to 2 different locations and no-one opened, they never came to our location! They said they would deliver a free pizza and then they turn around and say they will not send anything because they can't find the address! When we even gave directions! This place is unprofessional and petty! Gross and disappointed about this PLACE! NEVER ORDERING AGAIN!!!

So when i crave a veggie pizza i automatically call papa johns... But unfortunately tonight was not good at all i was told it would be 15 -20 mins. It took the driver an hour to bring it to me after calling and asking for the address again...now that he has finally brought me the pizza that i ordered he then admits sorry it took me so long i had to stop and get gas...so my pizza that i just paid $22 for is cold because you had to get gas #realnice #wontorderfromyouanymore
