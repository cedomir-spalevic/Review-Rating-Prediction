Went here a year ago on mothers day with my sister and her kids. The waitress was abominable. She was acting like she was waiting tables against her will. I didn't complain at first because I thought perhaps I was misinterpreting the situation however by the time the appetizers arrived she had walked away from us twice while we were still talking to her and one time I think she rolled her eyes at us. She was extremely cold towards us and rarely checked in with our table. At this point I couldn't complain about it for fear of upsetting my sister on mother's day. This situation was the absolute worst dining experience I ever sat through, and our bill was over $300. It was so uncomfortable, when that check arrived I was eager to get out of there. Maybe we were dressed too casually, or the waitress was having a horrible day. Whatever the case, I would avoid this place, just on the chance you might get seated with this server.

The Bomb!!!!!! Best Restaurant in Will,Crook and Kankakee county! I've never had lobster so fresh and tender,my 4 shrimp cocktail had to weigh almost 2lbs,the French onion soup is literally to die for! My steak was cooked beyond perfect and more tender then any steak joint in Chicago. My wife and I ordered 3 appitizers,we both had soup,steak lobstertails and chocolate cake. I had 2 rootbeers and my wife had 2 Cpt Morgan and cokes a d the bill was $165. So all around it was an amazingly romantic atmosphere, great food with excellent drink options. It's not cheap,but it is worth every single penny spent!!!

Great food. You never get a bad meal here. Great ambience, you can really enjoy a meal and have a conversation with whomever you are with and do not have to talk over a crowd of people as you have to in chain restaurants.
