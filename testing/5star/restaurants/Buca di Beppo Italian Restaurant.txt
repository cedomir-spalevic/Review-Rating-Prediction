The food and waitress were awesome. The host was a bit odd. Told us there was a 30 minute wait which we were fine with and told us to have a seat. He seemed a bit agitated that we wanted to wait. A minute later there was a table open and we were seated. All in all a great place to eat though!

Our host and wait staff were absolutely fabulous! Every time I'm here they are always super nice and friendly, however, the reason I'm leaving such a negative review is because of the management! The manager honestly treated the employees terribly! Oh my gosh I even saw the guy recording and berating an employee at the to go counter. Talk about unprofessional. I have been to the orland location since, and the second time all the employees looked as if they were chickens running with their heads cut off! I overheard an employee mention how she was working 4 rooms by herself... that's crazy! A single waitress for 4 rooms during a busy Sunday night is ridiculous. I don't blame the waitress, I blame the management. The poor girl was way over worked and did the best she could. Management here is trash, please fix it. This used to be one of my favorite restaurant but now I'm hesitant to come back knowing how poorly these employees are treated.

The fooooood! This place is delicious! Lots of garlic!! Subtle, but there... Everything is ordered family style, so your dish comes to your table on a platter for the others in your party to enjoy. Some of the wall pictures have answers needed, but whatever. They're Italians!! Everyone orders something different, and you leave fat and happy as hell!!
