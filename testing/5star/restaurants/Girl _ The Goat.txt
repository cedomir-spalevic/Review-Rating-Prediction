Everything was so amazing! There were 3 of us so we got to taste a lot. We had the beets, the chickpea fritter (probably my favorite), the goat empanadas, pig face (don't pass this up just because of the name), the crispy pork shank, and the goat belly. I recommend every single one. The ring of fire is also an amazing drink if you like something a touch sweet and spicy. Definitely plan to make reservations a few months ahead of time if you want to come here while visiting Chicago.

Totally worth the couple of months wait after I was able to make reservations. 
Plates are meant to be shared, so get a couple from each area of the menu. Everything we had was Michelin Start worthy. 
Cocktails were great and the bill wasn't insanely expensive. 
Definitely recommend if you can get reservations!

What can I say that hasn't already been saidâ€¦ I don't know. The food is fun, the atmosphere is inviting and the service was great. Could not ask for more. We let the waitress pick the dinner for us and not only did she have fun doing it, but she picked some great items for us to try. I have already recommended to my friends

My wife and I were looking forward to trying this restaurant over any other during our anniversary weekend in Chicago. We presented without reservation, but got an immediate seat at the bar. Ordered a martini, which was served in a weird margarita-type glass that wasn't iced as a martini glass should be. The beef ribs had more bone than meat, and the amount of meat couldn't have been 2 ounces. Same with the sockeye salmon, minimal amount of food. Both were delicious albeit. Pork shank could be a meal and was wonderful. Felt we wasted money on the first 2 very small plates. Waitress was lacking in table side demeanor. Of all the restaurants we visited, this was our least favorite.

Outstanding food, great service and delicious drinks. One of my favorite restaurants. Only con is you need to reserve a table weeks in advance. It is well worth it. The oysters were west coast, creamy and refreshing. The ravioli had an escargot filling which was very rich and tasty. The goat empanadas and skewers did steal the show. The desert was great too, just ate it so quickly that I was not able to take a picture of it.
