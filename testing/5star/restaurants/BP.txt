Pretty much the best gas station I've ever been to. The gas pumps are new and clean, the store was well stocked with Fair Oaks Farm ice cream and lots of other good stuff. And most amazingly, there was a huge dog park at this station. The dog park was nicer than any park I've been to in Washington DC. It had big and small dog areas as well as fresh water fountains. It's kind of an oasis of awesomeness off of I-65.

It cannot be called a gas station if there is no gas. Stopped by off the highway and all the pumps were out of order. If all you need is gas, it's better to just keep going and find the next one.

We were able to pay at the pump just fine.

Note the hours are 4am to 11pm not 24 hours.

This is the best for food options and one of the best bathrooms between Chicago and Indy!  They also have farm fresh snacks, good beer choices, and the BEST CHOCOLATE MILK!

We stopped to fill up, purchase drinks and snacks and use the bathroom. The bathroom line was all the way to the registers. Then when we finally get inside the bathroom, the second stall didn't have toilet paper ( I used napkins), which is understandable since it seems to be a busy place. After I finished using the bathroom I realized that the toilet didn't flush. Here's where my problem is. One of the ladies that left the bathroom a few minutes prior, infomed the cashiers at the front about the toilet paper situation. When Alyssa (the cashier) came in the bathroom with two rolls of toilet paper I said..... excuse me ma'am, the second stall, and that's where she cut me off and rudely said THANKS. I was a bit thrown off by how she came across and cut me off, to say the least. I then replied with, ok, but I'm not talking about the toilet paper (which would be silly, since I saw her come in with some). If she's having a bad day, maybe she should have stayed home.

Convenient fuel stop and a welcome rest along I-65. Expanded convenience store with a café. Clean bathroom. A free, expansive dog park is offered in the field behind the convenience store (see attached picture).

If you arrive during business hours, the full service Fair Oaks Farms café, cheese, ice cream, chocolate, and gift shop is available next door and the table service Farmhouse restaurant is available a bit further down the parking lot.
Also, farm tours and other experiences are available during business hours.
