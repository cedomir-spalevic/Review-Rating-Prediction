Bottom Lounge was the venue for our recent wedding (September 2017) and it was perfect for our 80 guests. We had the ceremony and reception on site, utilizing both the indoor and outdoor space on the second floor. Natalie is their wedding coordinator and is absolutely wonderful to work with. She's very efficient, knows what she's doing, and makes sure that everything looks amazing on the big day. She has an inventory of items, such as dessert platters and cut wood discs for display that she's happy to let couples utilize. The space already has nice lighting, a Chicago feel, a permanent bar, and a DJ booth, so it saves the time of trying to plan the room from a completely "blank canvas." The optional photo booth and pinball machines are a fun touch. The food was delicious and was served family style. It was an overall great planning experience and perfect wedding day. Thank you to Natalie and everyone at Bottom Lounge!!

Was there for an event for TechWeek. We were upstairs in that space which was nice. It was small for the group that was there. The service was excellent all the bartender were attentive to however stepped up to the bar even with all the people that were there. That is one reason I would come back. Also since I didn't have a change to have any food there. I have to see what it's like.

Awesome Venue , Even with a packed house we still had a great view of the Stage and Performance! The Resturant was also very impressive with delicious burgers and stiff drinks while we waited for the Show to Start I would most definitely recommend a visit to take in a show or grab a bite to eat

Never having been to this venue before, we bought tickets to a show for my 19 year old brother's birthday. Upon arriving I felt immediately uncomfortable by the sketchy location. Apart from several guys hanging around outside, the area was deserted. We got there early, received our wristbands, and proceeded to wait around awkwardly. I'm 21 but don't drink in front of my younger brother, I also drove. When we sat down at a booth to order food, we were accosted by a big, black, security guard who seemed to be out of his mind. It turns out my brother was given the "wrong colored" wristband (same as mine), even though there were black X's on his hands indicating that he is not 21. Having been there for barely 15 minutes, we were screamed at, berated, kicked out and forced to make the hour-drive back to the suburbs. I have never been so disrespected in my life. With the help of our parents we are filing a dispute against this place, but based on other reviews I've read, the men who work here need to be fired.
