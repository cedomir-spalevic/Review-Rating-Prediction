Arby's is great when they run deals. Way too expensive when they don't. Good thing is that they are almost always running some special.

There's always great sandwiches and there's always a good deal going on (like get two giant $5 sandwiches for the price of one). 

And they've got the best fries out of any fast food place.

The place was clean and the food was good. It was not crowded so the food came out fast. Its a good place to stop if you like Arby's food. The bathrooms were clean too.
