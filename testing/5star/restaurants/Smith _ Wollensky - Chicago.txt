Great place to dine for any occasion . had one of my best Valentine's day dates here. After dinner we were invited down to the lounge for some wine and cigars. Hospitality at its finest.
Oh and the Porter House Steak along with the South African Lobster tail was a signature satisfaction I have yet to forget about. ( they dont come together,  I had to order two entrees)

No matter what anyone says, this is THE steakhouse in Chicago. Excellent service & food! Pricey...yes but totally worth it. Very beautiful view of the marina if you eat outside on the patio. Great for a romantic evening.  This is a "must do" if u are in Chi-town! I strongly recommend

Amazing food. This made our trip complete. The steaks were on point, the staff was amazing, and at the end of it all they gave us 2 amazing desserts with coffee on the house. Def a must do and make sure you go hungry because you get so much steak it's crazy!

Staff was friendly and service was great. Unfortunately our steaks were not prepared correctly the first time. Two filets were undercooked and had to be sent back. When we did send them back, they were returned promptly and prepared at the right level. 

The sides are ok. We had the mushrooms, sprouts, and fries. I’d skip the sides completely next time and maybe go with a different potato side or the asparagus. 

The gigantic chocolate cake was huge.  It can be split by at least 4 people!

If they just stuck to steaks and cocktails this place would be 5 stars. 

The sides are offensively bad. The number of side dishes returned to the kitchen for being poorly cooked was nearly unbelievable; from simple baked potatoes, to mash, au gratin, and even the macaroni and cheese. The spinach had so much chili on it you couldn’t even tell it was spinach. 

I think this is a sad case of name recognition allowing for a strong dose of mediocrity. 

Train your staff and execute the rest like you do the perfectly prepared steaks.
