After reading a couple of reviews about the long delivery times, I decided to go ahead and place my order anyways and was prepared to deal with it. Imagine my amazement when approximately 27 minutes after I placed my delivery order they were knocking on my door. I thought that was kind of neat. I understand not all deliveries are created equal and some people are going to get a Raw Deal. I know, because I have been on the receiving end of Raw deals and extremely long wait times, but this time the entire experience from calling and placing my order, to the wait time and the actual delivery was pleasant, quick and friendly. I'm just in town while my truck is in the shop for the weekend, so this is the first time I've ever ordered from this particular Domino's and I would personally order from here again. Thanks Domino's

Watched the girl in the back make a pizza with no gloves on. She wiped snot on the back of her hands and kept working, disgusting.

I ordered on line and it stated my pizza was started at 6:59pm. I arrived at the store to get my pizza at 7:25p and it was not done. I was told it would be another 7mins. It is now 7:45 and I'm being told it is still not done. If I would have known it was going to be this long to carry out I would have gone somewhere else. I mean it looks like delivery is getting theirs faster then carry out. I left without my bread cause it was just now cooking
