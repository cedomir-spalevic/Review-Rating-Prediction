Went here for dinner after seeing Hamilton at the Private Bank Theater directly across the street. We arrived at 4:30......very early but had great service and a delicious meal. Had the sea bass and it was outstanding! My friend had the roasted chicken and enjoyed it. Good service, kind waiter!

One of the most tender steaks I've had. We got reservations for dinner before a show. (I was in the room where it happened) and they timed our meal perfectly. 

The decor is dark wood and very cozy. We didn't drive so I don't know about parking, sorry. It was a pricy meal but worth it.

We came here since it was right across from Hamilton & we were looking for a good steakhouse. It did not disappoint! We got the 8oz filets with a side of giant baked potato & it was so delicious!! A great cut with very good flavor, it practically melted in your mouth. An added bonus were their cocktails we're Hamilton themed so of course I had to order one (or three). If you're looking for a great steakhouse look no further, though I'd recommend a reservation as a lot of people seemed to pick this place as a place to grab a bite before the play.

A group of 5 of us came here for dinner before seeing Hamilton on 9/16/17.  This was a unanimous choice by our group for one of our favorite meals of our entire trip.  Our server was excellent, polite and attentive but not overbearing.  Several of us got Hamilton themed cocktails which were excellent.  My entree was a grilled pork chop with wine poached pears, carrots, and demi.  It did not disappoint.  Everyone enjoyed their food and kept talking about how much we enjoyed the meal for the rest of the night.  I think some reviewers have a naive idea how much a pre-show meal should cost.  I thought our meal was priced about right given the quality of the food and service we received.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back.
