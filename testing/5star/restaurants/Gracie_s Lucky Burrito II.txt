Went today on lunch--I do frequent the location as it's close to work.  Today my experience was so terrible, I took the time to write about it. While the food is ok, not many choices in the area, I usually go there for the quick service.  When I walked in, I stood in line behind someone who appeared to be paying for their order.  The young lady behind the counter walked away.  Didn't strike me as odd, then no one came to the window.  After standing there a couple minutes, another young lady comes to the window, stands there, says a couple words to her co-worker and closes the window.  I'm still standing there.  I open the window and asks where can I pay for a to go order.  She does not respond.  I assume she didn't understand me.  When another young lady assisted me, I explained what occurred.  Her response, "She does that all the time!"  She apologized profusely and really felt bad.  Food not bad, service from that particular person today, TERRIBLE enough for me not to give you any more of my money!!!!

Good food, slow service, check you order before you leave sometimes they get the order wrong but the nachos are amazing!

Food looks good and the amount of food is ok, the flavor still needs some love in it, as well as the temperature of it! But averall it is a good place for something fast to eat.

Everytime w/o fail my order is incorrect. And everytime your employees are so very rude to try to put their incompetence and lack of motivation to pay attention to detail off on me. I don't know why after i told your staff my order, your staff read it back to me and i confirmed by repeating the order. So if i ordered only cheese on one of my tortas there shouldn't be anything on it but cheese and meat due to food allergies, and if i ordered 4 flour tacos w/ eggs & chorizo then i should get exactly that not corn tortillas. If your staff does not know how to follow directions, pay attention to detail and above all does not know how to make a taco then they should not be working for you.! I wish i could give you negative stars for all of the bs that I had to deal with due to your incompetent non-taco non-burrito making employees. I expect my full refund or im reversing the charges anyway!
