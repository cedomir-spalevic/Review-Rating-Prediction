First time try it. Very clean modern fast Asian food. Staff very friendly. Unbearable price! I had fresh noddles for less than $7. I wish they open a restaurant in New York.

I had Japanese pan noodles which was pretty good and Thai chicken soup which was excellent. Interior is pretty plain. Staff are friendly and cheerful, but I didn't interact much with them.

Great and fresh food. If you fill up a review you get a nice appetizer for free! they used to give the utensils/silverware with the food, now you have to go and pick them up by the drinks fountain.
