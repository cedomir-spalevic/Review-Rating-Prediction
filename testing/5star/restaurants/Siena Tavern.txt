It was a little noisy but the food was amazing and the service impeccable. We split the Hearts of Palm salad and then selected the short rib ravioli for our entrees. We split the sticky Parmesan potatoes because it sounded too good to pass up. It was a good call. There were no leftovers. All the food was beautifully presented and full of flavor.

I came here for a business lunch and it was very good. The menu is full of traditional favorites with the restaurants own special unique tweak to each dish. I went with the very basic burnt pepperoni pizza and it was excellent. We also shared some starters which were off the charts good. The service was also very good. All in it was a great experience.

Came here for brunch today and it was such a great experience. The avocado toast was pretty good, all fresh ingredients. My mom had the eggs Benedict with pesto hollandaise and it was incredible. Really would love to come back to try some other things on the regular menu.

What an incredible dining experience!  The food is fabulous. The eggs with mushrooms, the lightest pancakes. A beautiful restaurant with great service. If I lived in Chicago, I would eat here very often.

Large dining room with sleek decor and huge, 360Â° bar in the lounge area. The layout was well designed so that those seeking a lovely dining experience could do so without any disturbances from those enjoying a night on the town.

Gabe and the rest of the bar staff are great. They all work well together and often times greet us regulars with a wave despite the fact that they are juggling multiple tasks at any given moment. Bar food menu is brilliant, Italian light fare that hits the spot without sending you to bed. 

The resident DJ on weekends keep the uptempo atmosphere peaking by mixing popular hits and classic house with contemporary electronic dance music.

All in all, Sienna Tavern is SLEEK, SEXY, SAVORY & UPBEAT. Conveniently located at Kinzie & Dearborn Streets in Chicago's River North neighborhood. This is a destination to see and be seen so dress to impress, especially on the weekends. How much you spend is up to you. A tab can range anywhere from $30 per person to well over a hundred if you lose track of the number of craft beers or signature cocktails you and your guests enjoy.
