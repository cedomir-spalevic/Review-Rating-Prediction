Never had a bad experience. I have had delivery and dine in. It's generally a good experience and the food is always good.

Great food with impeccable service! I have been to this place multiple times and was never disappointed. And their price is reasonable.

We ordered soup, sushi, rolls and an entree. Everything was fantastic. We thought the pricing was a bit on the high end, but once we saw the portion size and tasted how great everything was, we realized we were getting a deal. We still have enough left over for an entire meal of leftovers.
