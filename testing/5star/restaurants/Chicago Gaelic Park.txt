My cousin recently had a wedding here, there was almost nothing good about the place except the decorations and the manager. The food was awful. The wedding cake was cut and served when it was not suppose to be. The bartenders were not friendly at all and service overall was very mediocre. Worst of all, many decorations and valuables for the wedding were seemingly stolen by the employees and days later have still not been found. 

I would not recommend this place for anybody, especially if you are going for something special like a wedding.

Great for banquets. And their live music night are good too. Just get to an event early so you don't have to park in their overflow lot

I have been here twice for a funeral luncheon and a baby shower. Both times the room was great, service was good and the venue itself is such a nice open place to hold events. The rooms all break down to the perfect size for your event including a great outside area.
