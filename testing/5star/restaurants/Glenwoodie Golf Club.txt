Course was in GREAT SHAPE.  Haven't played there in a while. Pleasantly reunited with Glenwoodie.  DEFINITELY will return.  Clubhouse is beautiful.

Course is in great condition, even after drought conditions in the early summer.  Greens were sanded slightly, but they still were fast and true.  Fairways were immaculate and pace of play was great.  Back nine is much tougher than front nine.  Watch out for 14 and 16, very tough holes for low handicappers.

Glenwoodie is a beautifully maintained course. Greens can be somewhat challenging.
