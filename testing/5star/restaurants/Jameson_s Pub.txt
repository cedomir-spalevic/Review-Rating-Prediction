Nice log cabin design. Place is clean. Waiting staff similar to Tilted Kilt, but a bit slow. Food and drinks were good. Daytime female bartender was nice and efficient. Nice outdoor patio with a view out back.

Atmoshpere is fun and casual.  Good selection of food and it came out hot. It was delicious.   Outside seating is a very good size.

Fantastic place to eat and have adult drinks food is great along with staff,the only thing they need to do is give you extra bigger napkins to wipe your hands bar napkins don't work well. Lol
