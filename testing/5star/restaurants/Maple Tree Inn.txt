A hidden gem in the south burbs. Authentic New Orleans style meals at affordable prices. I would recommend a call before taking the trip. They have weird hours. Live entertainment on some nights. Love the pecan pie... but they will not serve it w/ ice cream ðŸ˜”

Great experience. I ordered the wrong cocktails and the waiter exchanged them with no problem. Food was delicious, I love the cool atmosphere of Maple Tree. Even the soundtrack was an oldie r&b which lent to a fun evening. The mgr recommended a wine which was a winner. Overall great experience.

Great little hidden gem in Blue Island! Good food, craft drinks & beautiful decor make this a real winner. Place is small, so I'd definitely recommend reservations to beat the wait.
