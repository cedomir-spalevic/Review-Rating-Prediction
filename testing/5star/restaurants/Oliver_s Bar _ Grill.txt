Great place for an affordable meal. Decent beer selection, sports are always on of you're into that. Only complaint I've had is the bald bartender with tattoos is rude.

Always a good time. Good food and drink options if you're ever in the outer south region of Chicagoland and need a decent getaway that is still within reach of the metropolis.
