When it comes to your favorite chains, consistency is key. I tried the Native Foods Cafe in San Diego as well at this location; and the bistro steak sandwich is just as delectable. Great place to catch up with friends and people watch. The lavender lemonade is fantastic! ðŸ‘Œ

I visit this restaurant frequently and I am never disappointed. My favorites there are the native nachos and the big ole burger. Meat eaters and vegans alike can definitely find something theyâ€™d enjoy. Plus the fact that they serve wine makes this place an automatic win in my book!

Vegan heaven in the heart of the loop. Staff is great, selection is amazing, and service is quite fast even when busy. I highly recommend their baked goods/desserts as they are excellent. Bring even your least vegan friends and I guarantee they'll be pleased.

LOVE this all plant-based restaurant chain! Seasonal menu features in addition to mainstays. Be sure to get your frequent customer card and get a free meal. Love animals, eat plants. #vegan

Although it is all vegan and that is amazing, we were expecting something better. My curry bowl had no flavour and a bunch of are vegetables, nothing special, and we don't go out to try non special things xD, at least the sauce. Sandwich greasy. Cupcakes almost 4 bucks each, dry and hard...

We will give it a couple tries more with different dishes. We may have gotten the weak dishes the first time.

Overall, nice place to go for vegan people.
