This place has decent food, but the service is s-l-o-w.  Everytime I'm here our service is slower and slower and slower.  If you have a couple hours to enjoy a long meal service, this is your place.  Anyone else who expects dinner service to be shorter than a theatrical movie should steer clear.

I love this place great local beer selection and the service is also always good. And the food is fantastic do yourself a favor and come here instead of where you were intending on going.  Me and my girl favorite waitress is Jessica she is awesome ask for her!

Not only do they have great beer on tap, they also have great food!  A little loud at times but you can still have a conversation with the person next to you. It is a little challenging to hear everyone if you're with a group of people.
