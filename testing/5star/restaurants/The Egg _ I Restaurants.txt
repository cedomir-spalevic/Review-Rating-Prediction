They can't accommodate the traffic they get. I placed an order for pickup. It was incorrect. Waited 20 min for another order, it was also incorrect. People was complaining and leaving while I was waiting for my order. Not worth the hassle. There are better establishments with better food. I will never go back.

This is a better than average breakfast place. I ordered the veggie benedict and it was fantastic! The sauce was obviously made from scratch, light and tangy. All the vegetables were freshly sauteed. My side of grits needed salt, but l am a salt freak. They had a perfect consistency. Our waitress was humorous, friendly and efficient; the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. I'm a fan!

The food here is good. I've only had the Texas steak skillet, but that's because I like it so much. The steak is flavorful and tender and it's served on a bed of well-seasoned potatoes, onions, & peppers with your choice of eggs on top. You also get your choice of bread on the side - I always get the pancakes, which are very good. I took off one star because the check-in process is often chaotic with people checking out as well. And service can be spotty depending on which waitress you get.

This place has good food but the service is terrible!!!! It wasn't crowded but they sat us all the way in the back. We had no napkins, no silverware, no syrup, and we had to constantly ask for it. No waiter came to check on us. No water refills anything. It's sad that the food is good but the service SUCKS!!

What I did not like about this restaurant was the service. It was not busy and they placed us right next to a bunch of loud business men. Our waitress was not very good either. We know they have different flavors of coffee. She never asked what kind we wanted just brought us regular. Brought us our meal and then never checked back to see if we needed anything. Took a long time to get the check. The food however, was good.
