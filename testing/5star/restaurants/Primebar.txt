So good! We ate before a show and the waitress was super efficient and delightful! Chicken sandwich, burger, and "tatchos" were great. Chicken sandwich flavors were well balanced and chicken was super moist!

Went here for a happy hour after work. The food was good, but prices were a bit high. Our waiter was easily confused and our food wasn't prepared together, so even though we ordered dinner all at the same time, entrees came out sporadically. They do have Andes mints at the door, so be sure to grab some of those on your way out! Don't grab the entire bowl though, the host doesn't think that's funny. :)

Great entrees, great desserts... GREAT desserts ( order the carrot cake).

Though you'll have a better experience at night with a much livelier atmosphere.

Thoroughly enjoyed my whole experience here! The food was fantastic and had great decor and atmosphere. Was significantly less busy than I would have expected for how highly nice and delicious this place was. Our waiter was funny and personable. The drinks were well made. Would highly recommend this restaurant!

I went to dinner at Primebar for a 7pm dinner on a Saturday, and it was almost completely empty - probably due to the fact that Wacker is mostly a business street. The drinks were good and the prices for the food were fair considering the portion sizes. My issue was that while the food came out quickly and at the same time as the rest of my party, it seemed cold? That surprised me since there were only maybe 4 other tables.
