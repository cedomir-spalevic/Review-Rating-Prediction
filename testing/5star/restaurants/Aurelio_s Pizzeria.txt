As usual the food was good, but we stopped at 1230 for the buffet,  we are vegetarian, and to wait 30 minutes for a cheese pizza. We could have just ordered our own at that rate. Our lunch time over before you can eat

Buffet was excellent. I wanted some salad and a couple of pieces of pizza with no leftovers, so this was awesome. Nicely priced, too.
