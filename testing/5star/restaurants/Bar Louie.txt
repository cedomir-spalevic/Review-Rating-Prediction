I really enjoy Bar Louie! Cheap drinks, and really cheap burgers on Tuesdays. For being a dollar, also, the burgers are pretty good, though of course, the specialty burgers are much better. My boyfriend and I come here whenever we can just for a night out. We love the food, and we also love the ambiance of the bar: not too crowded, not too sports bar-ish, just a fun and cozy place for food and drinks.

We originally went here for the outdoor patio and craft beer, but ended up staying inside for lunch and multiple drinks once we saw the great food selection and interior design. 
Good food, good service, and amazing atmosphere.  Highly recommended.

Nice venue and always love everything I get here. Buffalo wing sauce is the best I've ever had and I worked at a famous BBQ restaurant in college and it doesn't touch it.

At Bar Louie you'll get decent food and drinks at a decent price, but it generally won't be a the best in class of anything. That's okay, because if you just want to grab a quick bite or have a casual place to hang out with friends that isn't a total dive this fits the bill. 4 stars over 5 because it seems to the bartenders are understaffed and whether you sit at a table or the bar, drink service is a liiiitle slower than what you'd expect.
