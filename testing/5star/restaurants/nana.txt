An interesting upscale diner that blends American and Latin cuisine. Only open for breakfast and lunch. Has outdoor seating in the summer and the inside is covered in beautiful paintings. It can be a little loud inside so it's not ideal for conversations but it's all over of my favorite brunch places. 
There are lots of healthy and how free options and they source most of their food locally.  They also serve great coffee and offer cocktails and beer.

I had the plantain sandwich. It was good. I like the atmosphere and the service was excellent. I think we went at the wrong time. Brunch was only available. I'll be back soon and will update my review accordingly.

This is one of my new favorite finds. Everything was fresh, choices were incredible and the atmosphere was relaxing. Our waitress was very efficient and the manager Tomas was so kind. They treat you like family. 
I will definitely be back even if I have to travel a distance it is most certainly worth it.

I had the chicken breast sandwich with pickeled asparagus and fried Avocado fries. AMAZING!!!!
