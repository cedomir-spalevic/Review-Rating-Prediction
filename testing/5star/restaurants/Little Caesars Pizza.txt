I was blown away by Sara today. She was/is so polite, courteous, personable and professional that I had to praise her in a review. I received service from her that servers in an expensive steakhouse don't even give. She is a gem. I hope you realize what you have in her as an employee. Thank you Sara, (I'm sorry if I got the spelling of your name wrong). I hope you have a great day!!!

Customer service was great! This is the second location that I have gone too for the promo with extra. Neither location is making the pizza with extra...this sucks!!! You pay extra to get a regular pepperoni pizza. Some from corporate need to teach them that the pizza should look like the advertisement!

What do you expect when it only costs $6 for a large pepperoni pizza? A pie sent down from the great pizza maker in sky, made with love and care. Nope. Instead you get a food product the might be called a pizza, but it is a pizza in name only. In reality, it is pre-made, cardboard crusted, thing that holds some kind of red sauce, cheese and pepperoni slapped on top with no consistency resulting in one slice with a little sauce, no pepperoni and a pinch of cheese, and another piece might have barely and sauce, 4 pepperonis and cheese that only extends across 1/3 of the slice. Basically, I find Little Caesars to be suitable only to those who have a palate of a 10 yr old or a person totally unfamiliar with what a passable pizza should look like, taste like and cost. Otherwise, steer clear of this slop shack.
