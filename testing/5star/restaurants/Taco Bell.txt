Clean fast and friendly. The naked egg tacos were fresh, hot, and amazing!

I've been twice. Both times the staff was distracted and obviously in a hurry to get customers out of the way. I had to tell both cashiers to wait, that I wasn't done ordering. The food took forever to get, first time the order was wrong and what I did get was old and cold. Second time, the food was cold and all smashed. This place is horrible.

I went to this taco bell on June 29, 2017 and got a chicken quesadilla. Took 2 or 3 bites and didn't think it tasted good and threw it out. I ended up with Salmonella and have been on and off antibiotics ever since, today is August 3rd and I am going on another round of antibiotics and I can not get this kicked. I would not recommend this Taco Bell to anyone.
