They remodeling this place and it's only made it worse.  They took out customer seating for some counter that is never occupied.  The one girl that was there out a container of  salad on a fridge and let it sit there.  There is no room for sitting and the wait is always 25 minutes or more!  Everyone Huddle's together like homeless people and it's aweful.  The food was the most greasy and disgusting food ever!  The cook didn't drain the meat after frying it and poured the grease into my sauce!  I didn't eat it and the waitress took it off my bill.  She tried to call a manager 3 times but he never showed after 20 minutes of waiting.  Avoid this place!

We had a group of 9 people and she was absolutely awesome! 
Totally calm and made us laugh and smile!

My server was Darnel, literally the best server I've had. He was fun, very polite, very helpful and even took blame for messing our order up when it wasn't his fault. 5 stars for olive garden hiring him!
