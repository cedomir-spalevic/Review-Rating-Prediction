Came here for a post Marathon meal and was not disappointed. If you’re a couple or flying solo would recommend sitting at the bar. You’re able to watch this very talented crew create burger after burger brilliantly.

Even though they have an extensive beer and wine list we focused on the cocktails. Began with a pickle back (whiskey and a shot of pickle juice) followed by a Hemingway Daiquiri, Bees Knees and Old Fashioned. The list is their take on classics which all went down perfectly with our food.

If it’s your first time here and you’re hungry, highly recommend the double. It’s three patties, cheese, minced red onions and a delicious sauce. It comes with a knife in it which I promptly used to saw this beast of a burger in half. The bread and butter pickles are fantastic and their fries are not to be missed. You will walk out of here completely satisfied.

Delicious burger, amazing fries, but over hyped.

I really wanted Au Cheval to be my favorite burger place. I wanted to have a religious experience that would force me to drag my out of town friends here. However what I found was a delicious burger (get the egg and bacon) and awesome fries.

It was incredibly difficult to get a table. They have one line which forms for both people that have a table ready and for people looking to add themselves to the wait list. This causes confusion and would be better setup as two lines, perhaps add people to the wait list outside and people that have a table ready go inside?

Our wait ended up being about an hour which wasn't the worst I've seen, but it's still a long wait considering you can get excellent burgers elsewhere in the city without waiting.

Overall I'll come back someday. However this isn't going to be a regular spot for me.

The draw to this place is the Marketing and the visual appeal of the burgers. Don't get me wrong, the thick cut bacon, and drippy style burger is awesome, but it's a 4 Stars because overall, it's just not the perfect 5 star combination. I've had better burgers judging on overall taste. The vibe is cool, just really loud, and I probably won't go back unless I'm with new friends. Great place, but sure as heck ain't no 5.

I'm going to give it a three, I am going to admit that their burgers was Fantastic. However, take note, the waiting is too long, especially just for a simple dish that I am starting to think that they lack chiefs and cooks. Burger was great, it was fantastic but I can't really say it was worth the wait because just for a burger and other simple dishes, I had to wait a lot. This is not a Good place if you are hungry, however, this is a good place if perhaps you are not in hurry, and wanted to try a good burger then give it A go, just make sure that when you come to this place you are not starving. I hope they will improve.

The wait is long and there's no avoiding it. It is worth the wait. The burger is amazing and seasoned perfectly. It's so simple and I can see why everyone orders the burger. The cheese adds the creamy and salty element. The thin slices of pickles is just the bite of tang and freshness. The herb salad is so fresh and makes you feel a little better of yourself. The root beer complements the meal and adds the right amount of sweetness. It was such a fun meal and experience.
