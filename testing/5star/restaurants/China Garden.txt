The china garden is under new owners.  When my husband went inside,  he said he didn't recognize one person working there! I ordered Chinese vegetables and my husband told them, as we always have, to put some snow pea pods in.it. I have always ordered broccoli with snow pea pods and they have always put a bunch in it, we live out in the country, and when my husband looked in the order, they put THREE SNOW PEA PODS IN IT!! I called up and said I wanted to speak to the manager, and this bozo gets on the phone. says he can redo the order, we needed to come all the way back into town, and he'd take a dollar off! I told him that that wasn't acceptable, then he hung up on me! I called back, and told him that after all of these years, I had never been treated this rudely! He hung up on me! I called back again, and a woman answered the phone saying that I had reached a message parlor and that I had the wrong number. These people have no idea how to treat someone who's been going there for over 12 years! And btw,  the food doesn't even taste like it used to, and the fried rice tastes burnt. I know my husband and I will not be back in!!!

For a small town Chinese restaurant, the food here is pretty good.  It is largely standard Americanized Chinese food.  General Tso's Chicken, broccoli beef, etc.  The staff is always friendly and the take-out service is quick and hot.
