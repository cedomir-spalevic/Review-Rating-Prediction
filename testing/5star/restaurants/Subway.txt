I was hoping this subway would be open on time because ir says on Sundays in opens ar 8:00am and i was waiting in the parking lot until 9:00am and then an employee pulled in. Poor management skills.

This is a nice place to stop for a person on a vegetarian or vegan diet when you're downtown Tinley Park.
