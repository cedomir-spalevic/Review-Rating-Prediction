Very good chicken with great service.  Worth the price paid.  The next time I am in Kankakee, I will definitely stop there to eat.

Great service, food was good, but not great.  Standard diner fare.  Fried chicken was good.   Salad bar would have benefited from more fresh veggie options like broccoli, carrots, etc.
