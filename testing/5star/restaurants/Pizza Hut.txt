I ordered a meatlovers without ham and added mushrooms pizza at 5pm. When I got there to pick it was about 5:25 she said just a few more minutes. I waited to 5:40, the original cashier went on break do the delivery driver just returning took over. When I asked how much longer she couldn't find my order when she looked it up and went to the back to get it. Once I got home they did not give me the correct order just a regular meatlover. I assume she just gave me someone else's pizza. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because the pizza was good.

Thank you Terrance for your service! Not only was my food extra fresh & done in a timely matter! This visit did make my day better! I really hope management takes care of this employee because you can not get great customer service everywhere! I was in the worst mood the day i came in but his positive energy made it all better!

This is by far the worst Pizza Hutt in the region.  They are rude, slow and after given three chances got the order wrong 2x.  Their delivery service is even worse. The manager was snickering when I called to complain. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!
