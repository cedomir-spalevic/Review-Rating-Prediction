This is a great restaurant before or after the theater! If you are having dinner before the theater, make sure to let the waiter know and they will keep track of time so that you are not late for the show. The service at this restaurant is always great and the staff are very attentive, cleaning the table and replenishing water. One of my favorites is the chicken potpie but everything that I have had at this restaurant is delicious, including the fried calamari and short ribs of beef - oh and the Blueberry Lemontini is quite tasty! Overall, the food is delicious, the service is good, relaxing atmosphere and reasonably priced. I definitely recommend this restaurant!

Located conveniently in the Chicago theater district this made for the most fantastic pre-theater dinner we could have asked for! This was part of our daughter's 21st birthday celebration weekend and the chef and our server prepared everything phenomenally! The birthday dessert presentation could not have  been any better and the food was terrific with large portions!

Dined here twice during a trip in July 2017. Every dish was on point and generally fantastic. My party tried pasta, seafood, beef, and vegetable dishes and two desserts. All great. Tricky things like squid, scallops, and asparagus were high quality and cooked perfectly. Dinner for 3 about $125.

I stopped in for lunch after a day of shopping. It wasn't too busy and I grabbed a seat at the bar. One bartender seemed new but the other was very personable. I ordered a cider, which was delicious. I also had the tomato bisque and the Caesar salad- both which were outstanding. The bread basket that comes with the meal was fantastic as well. The decor is very classy and I imagine this would be a great place for a date.  Bathrooms were very nice and clean.
