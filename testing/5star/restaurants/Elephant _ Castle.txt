Always a pleasure when we are in Chicago.  Great pub food and drinks in a nice, clean atmosphere.   Fast and friendly service.  Recommend giving it a try after walking around the loop all day or seeing a show.

The food is excellent, and the servers are very polite, but they have it backwards: busboys come to the table faster than the waiters/waitresses. We got up to leave and forgot our takeout box (literally 35 seconds) and it was gone before we could go back. If someone asks for a takeout box and makes the mistake of leaving it, do not assume it's on purpose. They wouldn't have asked for a TAKEOUT if they didn't want to TAKE IT OUT OF THE RESTAURANT. Do better because the food is great.

Great beer English beer selection, Yorkshire pudding, Butter Chicken Poutine, Steak and Mushrooms Pie, Full English Breakfast were all top notch.  Weekend brunch menu is nicely optioned, servers are great to interact with.  Went twice over a weekend both times were the same great food and waitstaff.  I have already recommended it to people.  Worth a pop in.

Excellent food!  Poutine is great, Yorkshire pudding delicious.  Came twice on a 3 day weekend, it was that good!  Brunch is amazing, everything cooked perfectly.  Service is attentive, prompt and friendly.  Will definitely come back and recommend to everyone.

I have never had a waitress be so rude. Burger had nothing on it, I didn't not order it this way. She didn't ask me how it was for 10 minutes, while my other friends were still waiting for food. The burger was terrible. The fries are pretty good. The bloody mary? Sucks. Will I be back? Hell NO. Not for scrappy service and an attitude for sub par food. Not to mention a bone in the chicken. Nope. Nope. Nope.
