For fast-food, Pop's is good stuff. Their beefs, burgers, gyros and fries are as good as anyone's. The staff is already very friendly, and the place is clean. Never have to wait long for the food either. The only thing that bums me out is the wifi never works. They say they have free WiFi, but my older iPad won't ever let me connect because it doesn't meet minimum security requirements. I would go there a little more often if I could get connected.

I like this until they changed the onion rings totally garbage what they need to do is go back to the other kind so disappointed but I understand what is going on. Its called CUTTING CORNERS and CUTTING COSTS they don't care about the customer, I just found that out in a phone call to them manager didn't even give a rat's a**.

Just stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. Place is clean, service was friendly and our food came our quickly. There's a lottery scratch off machine by the door when you first walk in and two male emplyees kept walking over and buying tickets. Like, a lot. Lol
