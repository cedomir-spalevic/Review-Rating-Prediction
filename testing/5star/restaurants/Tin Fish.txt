The decor was attractive. The oysters and rock crab claws were fresh and very tasty. The fish choices were plentiful and our tuna and Alaskan halibut were delicious.

Great food if you love fresh seafood. and a good beer selection. It is a bit pricey but it's a decent value for the freshest seafood cooked properly.

I have to laugh at myself - I didn't care for the decor, until I visited their website for the hours and read it was a 1950's motif. Wow - Hemingway and Sinatra dined in restaurants like this. Now I thoroughly enjoy the surroundings. Oh, BTW, the food is superb, with many choices, and the service, especially from our favorite server, Nicole, is excellent.

This place is a treat.  I generally do not care for seafood, but I do like this place very much.  I enjoy what I order, usually shrimp and fries.  The atmosphere is very warm and comfortable, and the service has always been good to me and my group.  It's a bit pricey.  I've been there 2 or 3 times, and I will keep going.

The food was just o.k.  I expected better for the price.  The service was very pleasant.  I wouldn't go back.
