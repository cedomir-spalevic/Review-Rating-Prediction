Teibel's is a long established and phenomenal restaurant. I have been coming here for decades. The food is wonderful, the service always friendly. Don't pass up a chance to stop here if you are in the area!

We had a group of 13 go here for their all you can eat perch. It was delicious.  Since we were a large group, we had 2 servers.  They were outstanding! They laughed with us, they took pictures for us and with us. From the minute we walked in and were greeted by the most gracious and accommodating hostesses, til the minute we walked out the door 3 1/2 hours later, we were treated tremendously.  Thank you Teibels for making our night so special.

I was very disappointed today. My server was very nice but never came back to ask me how my meal was. My fish, well it was nice and hot was barely cooked. My French fries were wonderful. My carrots were not even lukewarm. A couple of them were ice-cold. I've been coming there for nearly fifty years and I have never had an experience like I had today.

We are from Illinois and cane to this restaurant by a recommendation of a local as a "fish" restaurant. It was late in the evening and we were hungry. Only 3 tables were occupied at 8pm on a Thursday. My wife ordered perch and I walleye. The salad came fast and were good. The fish, however, took forever, about 40 minutes. They were good, but took very long time. Despite the menu said ice cream comes with the dinner, the server said no because we ordered "moderate " rather than "dinner, a big disappointment.
