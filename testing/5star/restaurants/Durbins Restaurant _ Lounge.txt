Great service by the waitress and food was good.  Drinks were decent.  The bouncers though are basically giant idiots pumped up on steroids.  While violently removing a patron one of these grunts knocked into me.  I was on crutches so it's fairly easy to lose my balance and landed into one of their slot machines.  No apologies given and landed on my broken foot.  I will never return because of their desire to use violence over diplomacy.

Ordered delivery and got a fresh hot pizza within half the time of my expected delivery. Best pizza I've had in a while!

Yes this place is a local dive bar but service here is always above amazing. Everyone is so friendly, plus the place is clean and they have a great outside patio. Pizza is pretty good also. Another great plus is that you cannot beat the drink prices. I would definitely recommend this.
