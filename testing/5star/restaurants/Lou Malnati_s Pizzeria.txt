The pizza was tasty. Four solid stars. I felt like it was a tiny bit expensive, but not lacking in quality.  Much more willing to pay a higher price for quality when coupled with good service.

I've had there in Lincolnwood and it was great.  Not happy with Palos.  It was terrible.  I threw it out.

Always delicious, and they have both Gluten Free crust and a Sausage Crust (no bread) for a glten-free/low carb option! One of my Favorite sauces!!

Best pizza in Chicago bar none. I used to live in Chicago for ten years, I know. I currently live in Ohio, every time I'm in Chicago, I stop by Lou Malnati's and get the deep dish The Lou pizza. Amazing! Portillos is my second stop.
