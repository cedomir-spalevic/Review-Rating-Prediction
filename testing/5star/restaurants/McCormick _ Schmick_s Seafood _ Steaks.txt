This place was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time. Our server was totally miserable. Barely spoke and acted like we were bothering her. It was very clear she did not want to be there. Perhaps she was forced to work the patio when she was supposed to go home.I don't know but she was not happy. We sat on the patio with another couple. She came over and her first words to us were not hello but "so do you want drinks?'" We ordered bottles of wine and appetizers and when they came had to hunt her down to get forks to eat with. Then we ordered our main meal and I was brought the wrong dish ( I ordered salmon and got shrimp) so it had to go back. The rest of my table had their food and I had to wait for mine to be made. 2 other people at the table had ordered steak. One rare and one med rare. They came well and med well. Again we had to hunt her down for some cutlery to eat with. I finally got my dish and it was average to say the least. The steaks had to go back too. They were so over cooked. I understand mistakes happened but this was just horrid from start to finish.

Ordered small size portions of mussels and shrimp kisses. The portions we're much more than expected. Delicious, too. Especially the shrimp. ðŸ˜‹ Dined in the dining room during happy hour; a bit on the noisy side.

I'm bummed that the restaurant lived up to the reviews. The service is indeed terrible - I believe they have a staffing or organization problem because there simply weren't enough waiters/bartenders to accommodate guests in house. Waiter kept apologizing for delays but still only came around every 15-20 minutes and our food took forever. My salmon was pretty good, but expected it to be better for it being their signature "Scottish" salmon. Salads and sides were poorly plated. My boyfriend ordered his sirloin steak medium and it was extremely chewy. We're normally not picky, but it was really tough to eat.

Great experience. The food was good and the service was exceptional. Our server, Jeff, was very personable. I placed my order and he quickly recognized my southern accent. We began chatting about where I'm from and why I was visiting Chicago. He then went above and beyond to offer me and my friend some great advice about things to do while in Chicago. It was a wonderful experience!

I came here with my family. The atmosphere was nice.  Our waiter was very rude. Kept interrupting us every 10 to 15 mins. The waiter (he) touched  one of my family member (she) on the shoulder and kept his hand there in the most creepiest way ever.  When we received our dinner it was cold as ice and our waiter was no where to be found even though previously to that he was constantly interrupting us . We asked a bus boy if he can find our waiter but instead the manager stepped in an apparently this pissed off our waiter cause he started making condescending remarks and when he started to refill our water glass you can totally tell he purposely filled up our glass to the point where the water overflowed onto the table.  The food was awful. I give the location in Rosemont a five star the food there was awesome the waiters were professional.
