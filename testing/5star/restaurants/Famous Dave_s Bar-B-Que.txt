Food was not so good. Overpriced food with small portions. Ribs were very fatty. Catfish was overcooked. Not worth the money. I was not happy with this location at all. The walls have spider webs and dust all on them. Not the cleanest place. Staff was friendly though. Don't waste your money like we did.

Great service from Don and delicious food.  Enjoyed St Louis Ribs and my husband enjoyed St Louis  Ribs and Catfish Fingers. We also had a very good salad. Yummy meal!

The food was great üòçit was the time that we received the food that was the problem. We had a party of 20. Naturally, two or more servers are suppose to wait on our tables.... not the case here üòê We had ONE person for this massive party of 20. The drink orders were wrong. One whole side of the table didn't get their drink orders. (Which was mostly waters with lemon) ü§¶üèæ, food orders were wrong. The people who ordered last, food came out 1st.. it was a mess. 
Come to find out, the server told the other servers she could handle a party of 20 by herselfüò• For her incompetence, the manager took off 50% of our bills... which was fine. At the same time, if that waitress is still there, I would not like to be sat in her section. üòí she's a mess...

Excellent service! Starting from the host, then our waitor ( JR. ) rendered excellent service, then M.O.D.  (GUS) came to our table, and asked how service, and food where!  This is a 5 star restaurant!  The food is excellent, friendly staff. Great barbecue flavors compared Rudy s barbecue in southern texas!

One of my most favorite restaurants. 
Ribs are phenomenal. 
Price is reasonable. 
Service is incredible. 
Particularly, if you are being waited on by either J.R. or Tiffany. 
They are tops. 
Did I say we love this place  ?
Try it out, you will too.
