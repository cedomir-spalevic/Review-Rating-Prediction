Every time I go there I get shorted of toppings and ingredients.  Just bought a blizzard medium sized cheesecake type . At all other dairy QUEENS there are many chunks of cheesecake.  There was literally one tiny crumb . Just one . Last time I will spend my money here .

Food is good, sometimes the cooks aren't so good. But that's typical with most fast food places.

Went to DQ today, ordered 2 small cones. One chocolate, one vanilla, both dipped in chocolate. I posted a picture, and you can clearly see how much smaller the vanilla one is. I asked the man at the window to please remake the vanilla one, and he told me no, because they were made by two different people. Aren't any of you taught consistency?
