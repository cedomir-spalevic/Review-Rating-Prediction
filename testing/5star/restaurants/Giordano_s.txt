I've given this place 5 stars only because I can recognize that the pizza was well prepared. Warning to all tourists: Unless you absolutely love cheese, I wouldn't get too excited about Chicago-Style deep dish. It seemed to have about 5 times the amount of cheeses as a regular pizza from down south. It was worth the try, but just not my style. I bet the regular pizza is great. Other than that, the cheesy bread was amazing and the service was very friendly. Definitely recommend!

Good pizza. The meat lovers style was very salty but the crust was better than Lou M's in my opinion. We were seated for lunch on a Sunday without any wait - of course the pizzas take a long time to cook but there's no avoiding that. Cute decor! Beware that the small pizza for 2-3 people is actually a ton of food! Two of us could only finish half! Would return here again.

Came here for a deep dish pizza and ordered the meat lovers.  Service was quick. Great atmosphere friendly staff.  Good place to come for lunch or dinner.  If you order a deep dish allow plenty of time in your plans as it take a while to prepare.  All in all enjoyed the time there.

Walking distance from where i was staying...had to try Chicago Deep Dish for the first time.  Perfect place to come to.
Pretty easy to gorge; it's as if they took a wheel of mozzarella and worked pizza dough around it, served on a cake stand.  Tough place to dine solo as far as completing a meal, but very homely feel.  Since it's a chain, next time I'm in Chi, I'll definitely be going back if possible.

This was a good location, the food was fresh and delicious, restaurant was clean, and service was attentive. There will always be a wait at Giordano's but we did OK on a Friday night (on the late side). Plan ahead if you are ordering deep dish, so you don't get too hungry- they are not exaggerating when they tell you it needs a long time to bake (45-50 mins?).
