The greeter left me at the door so I seated myself at the bar to place a to go order.  Bartender ignored me sitting there. About 10 minutes later he asked if I had been helped. If my uncle had not chauffeured me here as an out-of-town guest to get a meatless burger in my new Vegan lifestyle I would have left!  Fries came out cold even though I specifically requested they be cooked fresh...manager sent fresh fries.  Knowing I was dissatisfied and it took him several times to get my order correct, the bartender apologized and put pep in his step. So, I gave the 3 stars for trying to make it right.

The only location I visit south, get my free burger every year. I was a little worried at first about being tempted after a change to a vegetarian diet, but the menu had vegetarian options that made me comfortable. Crew is always on the business, place is clean, and environment is nice with the decorations.

I just left and the service was excellent.  I could not have asked for more.  The hamburgers were good and the fries were great.

They used to be great when they opened, good burgers, cooked the way you order them, great service by people who wanted to be there and good atmosphere. The last few trips there have been disappointing to say the least. Overcooked burgers, cold fries, dirty tables, poor service and worst of all employees who would rather sit and stand around talking to one another then attentive.
