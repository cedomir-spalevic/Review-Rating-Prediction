I really can't say anything bad about this place. The food is always good and the service is pretty swift. I love the fireplace and  the gift store. It brings back a lot or memories.   The have a new fall menu with breakfast bowl that look so good.

Excellent comfort food experience!!!!!   Been many a time.  Most recently I. Ordered the pinto beans and greens and the yummy ðŸŒ½ corn muffins.  I went with a friend we had a great time eating and catching up with each other.   The chicken liver is good.  When I am really hungry I order the slow cooked pot roast.   The food is really good.   The service was good.

The grilled chicken salad I had was the best salad of my trip. I appreciate the Romans lettuce they use. It was also different because many ingredients were placed in separate places around the plate so you could choose how to mix the flavors.

I use to love Cracker Barrel.  No more.  My friend and I ate there last night and they brought her food but not mine. I never got my food for about a half hour, she was finished eating when they finally brought my food. They offered to bring her more. But she is old and can't eat much so we refuse that but they never adjusted the bill at all.  My country fried steak tasted like cardboard and the grits had a weird taste to them.

It was really an awful experience last night.
The hostess that sat us was dour. She never greeted us or smiled. We asked to be seated elsewhere  one waitress said " you want to sit at a dirty table?" And left.  Another waitress sat us and then cleaned the table. 
Our waitress got my order wrong.when my order finally came.  It came incomplete.  
Again when the complete order came I was already finished with part of the order .
Sorry to say I am not willing to return to Cracker Barrel .
