Pretty good food but VERY noisy!
The cheese soup is excellent but they only have it certain days so definitely call ahead if that's what you're interested in having.

I have been coming here for a few months. Service is great, the menu is awesome, no complaints. If you want to play the ponies or just enjoy some cocktails while watching your favorite sports this is the place to come.

 They have some good food, I had fish n chips here once and was quite delicious. Also, good burgers and soup as well. 
 Place is connected to an Off track Betting facility to bet on the horse races which is a separate business entirely. 
 The place, when busy, is usually very loud. Wooden floors and metal ceilings make for a loud building, so no intimate dining here. Casual and bar and grill atmosphere, they have lots of TVs with the horse races, as well as Chicago sports networks. Very loud.
 Good place for beers and food and a place to watch the game and perhaps do a little Gambling while you wait for your food!
Ample parking day or night. Did I mention it's loud? ;)
