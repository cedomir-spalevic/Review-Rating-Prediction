Absolutely the best food around. Steaks  are so tender and tasty.  Salads are very fresh and served on a cold plate. The rolls are awesome and hot right out of the oven. This is truly one of my favorite restaurants.

Did call ahead seating and was seated within 5 min. It was very crowded. Service was great. Our waiter was what a great waiter should be. Drink and bread refills with out asking. We were in a time crunch and he was on the ball. Food was delicious and cooked to perfection. We had steak, shrimp, salmon and chicken fingers. Definitely would recommend.

First time I've been to the Roadhouse that the music wasn't so loud you could actually have a conversation. It was early afternoon but it was a welcome surprise. The food is always great and the service was exceptional. 
Great place for a casual meal, great service, good food and the cocktails are really good.

Great service, great food.  Dakota was our server, and even though my girlfriend and I are the weird "same side of the booth" type, we felt welcome and not weird at all lol.  

Our side salads were lost somewhere along the way, but they more than made up for it.  

I've always loved the atmosphere and the music. 

Had a great birthday dinner.
