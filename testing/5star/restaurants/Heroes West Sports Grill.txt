Really horrible experience. Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent. But everything you get here you have to ask for. Get a burger well if you want any toppings you have to be the one to bring it up otherwise you will get a plain burger. The biggest problem here was my waitress, Taylor. She came by my table probably 3 times the whole visit. One to take my order. One to drop off my food. One to collect her money. I needed a fork the entire meal but she was nowhere to be found. It was obvious The check was supposed to be split but wasn't. When we needed her to split it we had to wait for 20 minutes. Just the way she talked to us was horrible. I felt discriminated. I would understand if they were busy, But they were not! Horrible visit will never be back

Delicious food but the bar needs help.  I ordered the same drink 3 times and everyone tasted different.  The final onne was juice because they ran out of cherries.  Instead of charging me $9 for juice how bout ask me if i would like to try something else.  My husband order a martini and it was less than half way filled.  We asked our server where the rest of it was with no response.  Come fornthe food wine and beer skip the cocktails

When I'm racing at Autobahn Country Club, the only place I go to eat in the area is Heroes West. Great beer selection, really good bar good.  Good atmosphere.  I like this place and I'm not even a sports bar person.

Honey habanero wings were very spicy but had so much flavor and cooked perfectly. Whiskey selection was outstanding to include various regional whiskeys, including local ones. The reason for the four is the bartender service was sub-par. They acted like they didn't want to be there and worked very slowly, no hustle.

Heroes is great lots of big screen tvs for sports, but we go there for the great food. Huge delicious wings, great pulled pork, waffle fries and burgers and a large variety of other options.
