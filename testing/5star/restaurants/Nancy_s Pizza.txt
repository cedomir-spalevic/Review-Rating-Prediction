Best pizza in the area, maybe even in the greater Chicagoland area! The description is wrong as they don't offer "stuffed crust" it's actually called stuffed pizza and it's made like a pizza pie. The thick, fresh pizza pie crust is first layered with delicious toppings, then layered with top-notch cheese and then finally with freshly prepared tomato pizza sauce. It's award winning and mighty delicious. It doesn't stop there though...the thin and rustic crust and also delicious along with pastas and sandwiches that are second to none! Whatever your taste buds are craving, Nancy's has you covered with something that'll exceed your expectations!

We have tried many pizza places, and while you can get good deep dish pizza at other restaurants, Nancy's is a notch above the rest!  Consistent quality and flavor.  Great crust!  We do not go anywhere else for pizza.

The food was fantastic and the wait time was minimal. The staff was very courteous. I am definitely going back.

Fantastic deep dish!  My very small thing to keep in mind is that there is no sitting room inside.  Other than that, I would totally recommend!

Recently ordered online with them, so far we have never had a problem. Got an e-mail confirmation that they received our order and our wait with delivery was about an hour. Needless to say an hour and a half later, Still No food. We love this place and have never had a problem until now. You would think being loyal customers they'd want to rectify their mishap, but they never did. On top of it all, we get blamed for their incompetence. Shameful they just lost our business!
