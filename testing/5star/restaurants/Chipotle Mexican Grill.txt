I stop in the area after  I left the gym last night and got a bowl to go. And when I got home to eat it was so good.  The chips and  guacamole was so wonderful I could not stop eating it. So I just want to say good team everything was wonderful. Keep up the good work! Be proud!

Food is fabulously fresh. Items are delicious. Their hard taco shells seem like they could be better: the bottom of the third taco got soggy when I started eating it.

Service was excellent, restaurant was clean, temperature was perfect.

I ordered 3 bowls using the online prepay option so I didn't have to wait in line. In arriving home I found that none of the 3 bowls were made as I had ordered them. Items were switched around, one had ingredients I did not order at all. I called the store and they told me to come over and they would correct the bowls for me and they would do something to reimburse me. I went back, she remade my bowls and gave me a coupon for free chips and guac. I spent an hour traveling back and forth to chipotle. Really defeated the purpose of ordering ahead. The whole situation was annoying and a waste of time. Next time, I'll get subway.

The chipotle at this location is very inconsistent. At times it's best chipotle ive had, other times the food will be cold, chips will be stale, and the pop won't be carbonated. Other times it tastes like it's fresh off the grill, hot and spicy the way I like it, and the chips were freshly made with the pop tasting better than in the can form. 

Favortie: steak burrito bowl. White rice, pinto beans, pico, corn, cheese, sour cream, guac, and of course the steak.
