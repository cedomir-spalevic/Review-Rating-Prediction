Food was good. I had a small Nacho plate and would order it again. My husband a Supreme Skillet dinner. He said it was good, but needed more meat. I noticed most of the food is $9+. The place was clean. The waitress was very polite and fast enough.

The waitress was excellent. The cook not so good. Food arrived cold. Hash browns hard. Pancakes tasted like wet flour. However the waffles were good.

Normally  good place to go if you go during the day or evening (early), however I do not recommend going after Midnight on most nights as I takes 15 minutes to get a single cup of coffee when there is only 3 other guests in the entire restaurant. I've only had a bad experience twice recently and both times I left disappointed. The most recent I left very upset.

Love love love the food here.  The loaded baked potato soup is to die for.  Staff is always so kind as well.
Update
5/8 Waitress was not friendly at all.  Catherine I believe was her name? Only reason naming, don't want any other waitress taking the blame.  Manager Was friendly.  Please smile Catherine, you work with the public.
First time ever I've had an unfriendly waitress.  Everyone else is wonderful.  Will go back...just not to her.
