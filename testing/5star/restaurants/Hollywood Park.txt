Best amusement business in the area.  I absolutely love the go karts.  I also like the VIP program and that they always get new games.

I recently went to a birthday party there and the set up was amazing.  They had everything a kid could want.  It was a super hero party and the kids had a ball!

Nice clean newish inside, just fast token consuming games ok prizes. Outdoors needs rehab all fencing, hardscape and mini golf prop houses need to, otherwise ok.
