We had breakfast here today, wait time, food and service were fantastic! We mistakenly got in the line where you pay but a waiter quickly noticed and took us directly to a table. As we left, there was a wait but they are fast so I'm sure it wasn't long. Selections were great! My daughter had the bacon waffles and they looked as good as they taste!

This place is a gem. I loved their service and food was amazing. Came from Milwaukee to a conference I had in Hilton Chicago hotel. And was looking for a great breakfast and lunch place. Just by walking one block down, found Yolk. I did look it up on Google and wanted to see what others said about this place. And boy where they right. Great food great staff and be coming to this place again when I visit downtown chicago.

Upon first entering the establishment, at first glance you see a packed place, full of patrans..... busy fast paced service with servings of massive proportions.  And then we sat down, explored the menu, discovering so many options.  Hardest part of ordering at a place you're visiting for the very first time is getting that first good meal.  My wife played it safe with potato pancakes, and she was in heaven.  I myself wanted a variety, thus I got the combo with eggs, bacon, sausage, seasoned potatoes, cinnamon roll French toast with icing and hot syrup plus side order of wheat toast.  Needless to say, we were in heaven. Every bite was delightful.  And our server was great, no complaints.  I love the water they provided.  Refreshing.  Overall, fabulous experience.  We will RETURN!!!!

There's a delicious little breakfast/brunch place in my hometown that serves the best mixed berry French toast. But Yolk's French toast far surpassed that. We had a wait to be seated, but the food was 110% worth the wait. Our waitress was so friendly. And the amount of food was definitely worth the price- I wanted to eat it all because it was so good but I just couldn't. Next time I'm in Chicago I will DEFINITELY go here.

Had a party of 7 and the put us in a table that barely sat 4. Ordered our food it came fairly fast but waited our whole meal for our drinks. Not a good experience in such sophisticated city.
