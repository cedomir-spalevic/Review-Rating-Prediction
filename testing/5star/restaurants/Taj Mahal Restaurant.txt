This place is a gem! Not only was the food delicious, but staff was extremely accommodating of my vegan diet. She made sure she understood what it was I do not eat and pointed out everything on the menu that was safe for me to enjoy. The place had a wonderful energy, was very warm and inviting. I had such a lovely evening! I will definitely dine here again and again!

I will not say that the Taj Mahal serves the tastiest or the most authentic Indian food, but it is not bad either. The best thing is that they have a buffet during lunch and dinner hours. The service is quite good. I quite liked the owner/manager. She seems a warm and an inviting person. The food, as I said, was okay. Although, in all fairness, I only had the vegetarian dishes and I thus can't comment on the meat dishes. All in all, it is a good place if you want a quick bite at affordable prices.

Went there for the first time in years and was impressed.  The quality of the food is great. We had the buffet,  amd the variety of dishes offered was good enough to accommodate everyone in our group.  I came with my family,  but it would also be nice for a date.

I stayed in Chennai, India for two weeks for work this last July - the food here was the most authentic South Indian cuisine I've had since being in India. The Chicken Biriyani was fantastic!

What are good?
Beef vindaloo, chicken butter.
Everything else is aweful. Biryani test is nothing like biryani. Vegetable pakora is full besan - no test of vegetables at all. Aloo gobi looks and tests  like hospital food. The kheer smells like medicine.
