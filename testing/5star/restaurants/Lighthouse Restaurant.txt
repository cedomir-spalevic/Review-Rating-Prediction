Food quality, presentation, and service were excellent. Had the Grouper special, potato leek soup, pulled pork tacos as an appetizer, a house salad, and special lemon raspberry multi-layer cake for dessert. Also had a Margarita. You could tell it was made with fresh lime juice, not reconstituted or syrup type, and there a full dose of booze. A very positive experience. It was almost kitchen closing time and we were not in any way rushed.  Other diners were having a good time too.

They were very busy!  However; we were on a rare date night so not a big deal.  It took a little while to get our entrees,  but I was offered a glass of wine on the house as a result.  Amanda Lee was our waitress - outstanding!  Request her!  I know we will in the future üñ§Food was EXCELLENT!  Well worth our wait.  Oh, we were early for our our reservation and went to the bar.  EXCELLENT service there as well by several friendly bartenders üç∑ü•É

Fantastic experience. We had a drink out on the patio and watched the sun set over the lake, then inside for a delicious dinner with appetizers. Make sure you don't wait until the last minute to book because reservations fill up fast.  Don't be fooled by some of the photos you see here in Google, either. It's not some giant banquet room.  Here's where we sat for our meal. 

Plus, ask for Donnell to be your waiter. He's awesome.

Food was very good.  Staff seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else at the time.  The hostess never greeted us.  She wanted for us to approach her and explain why we were there.  2 different bar tenders kept walking be without acknowledging we were there.  Then one bar tender finally did take an order after us sitting there several minutes.  But I notice she didn't ring the order into the register to its completion.  Our change was right and all but putting in the order, then cancelling it and still serving the drinks means the establishment did not get an accurate count at the end of the night.  Next our waiter was OK but again like he didn't really want to be there.  We were seated at one of the lake view windows and watched the sunset.  Very nice.

We went to celebrate a friend's retirement. We had a beautiful view of the lake and our server Emily was friendly and attentive. We enjoyed the crab cakes, wedge salad, and our steaks. Also, a great price value for a a restaurant that features steaks. We love the restaurant.
