Super tasty food, great service, and awesome value. I ordered a half barbecue chicken dinner and usually restaurants give you really small chickens but this place doesn't mess around. It was a pretty solid portion and I'm really satisfied with everything. You get your food, you sit down and eat. Simple and great

Great food, great service, great price! No complaints, it wasn't a mind blasting meal, but it was good food and filling. Perfect for the price range

At first I was a little nervous about going to get an intalian beef from the area, I read the reviews, & gave it a try.. It was so delicious, I got mine dipped w/mozzarella cheese, hot & sweet peppers& cup of cheese for the fries. My pop was kind of flat though, &its not even expensive.

Worst philly I have ever had in my entire life. Like who the flip makes a Philly with Italian beef meat. It was a wretched experience. The staff wasn’t even that nice they didn’t talk to their customers. Never coming here again!
