Great service & vibe. Food was tasty, brought out as asked with all modifications made properly & was hot!  Fish and chips were nicely battered with thick chips! Elk rack was smaller in portion than anticipated but, still glad we tried it. Mussels, great twist with the vindaloo sauce! Venison burger, cooked to the right temp, not dry and very flavorful. Would definitely go back!

Fantastic place to enjoy great food in a unique atmosphere.  Party up front, elegance in back, a place to sit for every mood.  The food was fantastic.  Plenty of selection and variation.  Nice wine list.  All in all a spectacular venue.

Had the butternut squash soup and it was amazing! Sat at the bar.  Bartender was quick and efficient,  but not friendly.  Either way, love this place.

 In the best and biggest away all I can say is Wow! We came here for our daughter's 21st birthday brunch--the restaurant decor and cleanliness was phenomenal, the food was fantastic in its Irish flare and Doody our waiter was over the top in the best of ways with his humor, professionalism and service! We asked if he would take a picture of our group and he took us to do different areas of the restaurant to Stage the photos for us! They have a fantastic party room downstairs and it's second bar that we have to find a way to use someday and would recommend to everyone!
