I worked a private event at the hotel that covered multiple floors and can say that the Hilton is gorgeous. I live in the South Loop and have walked by the hotel multiple times but had never been inside- it gorgeous to say the least. The staff were extremely accommodating and friendly to myself and team members. All of the rooms we used were clean and fully stocked at all times with anything we asked for. I would absolutely come back as a guest and will be referring family and friends to stay here during their next trip to Chicago.

The hotel is easy to access from main street. Interior is clean and welcoming lobby. Very open space, surprisingly they have an entire hair salon downstairs! Along with some cool anaxj shops and 2 gift shops. The pool is clean and gives you a great overlooking out to the park and lake. Room was comfortable and secure.

My stay was for the night of September 3, 2017.

I e-checked in and chose a room the day before on the Hilton Honors app, but my room was not even ready for me when I checked in around 4:30~5:00 pm even though check-in is at 3:00 PM.

The food at the restaurants on the property was nice. Loved how they had separate elevators for different floors to make them more efficient.

Having two restrooms in the room is an awesome feature that my friend and I really enjoyed. We were moved to a room with a city view, which was very nice. The beds and comforters were comfortable.

My biggest issue was being woken up on 3 separate occasions in the morning, once around 7~8 AM, again at a little after 9 AM, and once more around 10 AM by housekeeping trying to knock on the door to come in to clean and prepare the room for the next guest. I would understand if it was just once, but the second and third time was definitely an annoyance. I know that they can see who is in-house in the system and who is not. Check out time is not until 11 AM. So for them to consistently come knocking was rude and unprofessional.

When we checked out via their phone system. which is VERY convenient, I noticed that a bag of linens and sheets were just sitting outside of our room door.  That seemed quite unprofessional looking and a bit unsanitary. 

Overall, the stay was pleasant until the morning we were to check out. Location is also perfect, right across from the Buckingham Fountain.

Utterly stunning!! The rooms are very nice, especially the lake view rooms! Clean, well maintained and the lobby takes your breathe away. Waking up to the gorgeous Lake Michigan is quite an experience!!! Can't wait to go back!

The hotel is nice and the location was perfect.  The little food/drink place in the lobby is pure robbery.  I paid $19 for 2 bottles of water and a small bag of chips.  The only negatives for me would be the blue light from the smoke detector that leaves a nice blue light ring on your bed while trying to sleep.  The other negative for me and I guess it is a problem I should expect staying in the city is the constant horn honking and sirens...they never stop.  Other than that, my experience was great.
