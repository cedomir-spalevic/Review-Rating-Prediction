Went there for my birthday celebration. They were able to accommodate my party which was 15 people without any issues. We had plenty of room. The food was excellent, so worth the steak house price. I had the rack of lamb. It was prepared perfectly and tasted awesome! The service was also excellent. Definitely recommend this place for a dinner party or a quiet dinner for two.

All was excellent in the Dyer location! The food was awesome! Vickie our waitress was very attentive. The rest of the staff was on que. I truly recommend the Dyer Ginos restaurant.
