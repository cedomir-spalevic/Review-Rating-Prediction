If you're a die hard sports fan, then this place is definitely for you. It's like a Superbowl party of all sports. They have the perfect kind of food for that environment and the servers are absolutely awesome. I'm giving it 5 stars because the atmosphere was created for sports fanatics, but I really don't fall in that category, so I probably won't go back

Good food.  Love the boneless wings and my husband loves their burgers! Good atmosphere and pretty good service.  There enough to ask how were doing but not in your face every 5 minutes.

Standard fare for Buffalo Wild Wings.  Service was fine. Food was fine.  Just in general- don't think you get a lot for your money at BW3s

Last time i went there, was for lunch, and they have this thing, where they start a time when you order, and if it takes longer than 15 minutes its free. Well our time went over, so we only had to pay for drinks. Once that happened our service was TERRIBLE, the waitress completely ignored us, we waited forever for the checks, and we still tipped her awesome because the meal was free. I could not believe how unproffesional they were about following their own policy though! I will not be going back.

Went for lunch, food was hot and fresh, orders were correct. Service was fine, not great---seemed to take a fair amount of time for us to be greeted, seated and our order taken.
