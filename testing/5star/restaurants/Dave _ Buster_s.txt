One of our meals was not made with the rest. By the time it came out everyone was finished eating. The waiter was really nice about it and they comped some of our bill to make it right. The games and atmosphere here make for a fun time! Great way to get away from day to day life for a while.

I was a bit worried coming here. Seeing all the negative reviews on here and Yelp. However, my experience was the complete opposite of that. Our waitress, don't know her name but she was blonde and fair skin, showed up to our table within two minutes. Got us waters, refilled etc. She checked up on us periodically. All round GREAT service. The food was pretty great nothing astounding tho. I had the barbecue ribs with buffalo chicken. Fantastic. Crispy. Yet the pork was soft and moist enough to fall off the bone CLEAN. Pair the ribs with the cocktail Backwoods blueberry lemonade and you're making magic. It's a really good mix!!.  As for the games,it was a Little pricey. However, the old arcadey games are practically a steal.

Food was good, service was great, so if you're mostly going for the bar, you're set. There just arent quite enough arcade style games, and too many "ticket" games. Still had a great time though.

This Dave & Busters is the worst one to go to. The staff is not friendly at all. The bartender was horrible didn't know how to do his JOB he was HIGH AS HELL. I sat there for 30 minutes waiting on him he said he will be right with me then he goes and takes care of someone else that just walked in so yes I yelled at him and asked to speak to a manager the manager SHOULD NOT BE A MANAGER HE WAS VERY RUDE! I do not recommend anyone to go here they are GHETTO. You would think you would have great service because your in ORLAND NOPE NOT AT ALL THE WORST SERVICE I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! I will just go to the one downtown at least they have good service everytime.

We called this place two days ahead of time and were told that they don't take reservations. When we arrived, we were told that if there was a party of more than eight people, they couldn't seat us all the same table, but they could try to set the tables close together. What group do you know who goes somewhere for a birthday and doesn't want to sit together? Anyway, we were told that the wait time was 2.5 hours. Then we went up to question the staff about it, we were told that a party of 8 could sit together. We were also told that there were six large parties ahead of us. They were calling names for these people and no one was showing up, but all of us were there, and they still would not seat us. If you are reserving tables for other people, then that is a reservation! Thank God we left and went to a nearby Steakhouse. We will never be returning to this location. This place blows!
