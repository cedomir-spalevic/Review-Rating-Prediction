Kitchen closes early on Sundays. No dark beers. The staff was friendly and the locals were more than happy to chat with us while we were there.

Enjoyed this bar in the past when I use to live in Crescent City , IL . A lot of us bike riders stopped here because it is a great friendly place . Music on the weekends, good food, good people.
