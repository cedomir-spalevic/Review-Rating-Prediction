+1	So much fun! 
+1	So glad we have this family tradition!!! 
+1	Thanks Bengtson's!
0	The first time I visited Bengtson�s Pumpkin Farm, I was 11 years old and visiting with my Girl Scout troop. 
+1	I still remember the hayride to the pumpkin patch; which has since evolved to a much longer, more leisurely hayride. 
+1	Now more than 15 years later, I have enjoyed visiting the farm annually with my own children. 
+1	I live for the moments of pure joy my children feel while at the farm and am so blessed to have captured many of those moments in pictures. 
+1	I swear you can hear the laughter coming straight out of the pictures. 
+1	Bengtson�s is so well kept and maintained; it offers plenty of fun for all ages and needs. 
+1	The staff members are truly the cream of the crop! 
+1	If you have not been, it is definitely a place you�ll need to add to your list BUT BEWARE...you�ll never be able to just go once. 
+1	It is sure to become a family favorite and like ours, a tradition. ??
+1	This place is awesome! 
+1	I was here for like 3 hours and wasn't bored at all. 
+1	There's so much to do here it was like six flags all over again! 
+1	I would definitely come again. 
+1	Everything is free except the food and drinks of course and that only $2-$5. 
0	They also had tacos pizza and BBQ. 
+1	Not sure how much that was because we had ate earlier but it's nice to have a bunch of options. 
+1	It was my first time and I had a blast. 
+1	Also I'm 24 and brought my 2 friends, there was no kids with us and we still had a fun time.We are the ultimate Pumpkin Farm Junkies, we had gone to all the Wisconsin pumpkin farms and just wanted something different so after some google searching, we discovered Bengtson's and decided to try it out! 
+1	After driving 2 hrs, we loved every second! 
+1	The drive from WI was great too different scenery! 
+1	My kids (5&10) both enjoyed it! 
+1	Worth every penny- pictures are simply amazing with the background and such a great family friendly environment! 
+1	Tons to do: animated characters, races, hay ride, corn pit rides, etc! 
+1	Food prices are very reasonable for a family budget! 
+1	Rides are unlimited, with  your entry ticket! 
+1	We are def going to make this trip again!  
+1	I 100% recommend this farm, if you haven't gone- don't miss out, you wont regret it! 
+1	(p.s. they have the cleanest potter johns I've ever seen- always a plus in my book! ?)
+1	I took my girls here on opening day of this year, my daughter's had such a blast! 
+1	It wasn't busy and we got to go on the rides many times and the employees were so friendly and because it wasn't so busy of lines they let the children stay on the ride to go on again! 
+1	Very kind! 
+1	The new cow ride omg it was a blast, I even loved it and I'm 30 :-) we went on that many times. 
+1	The corn pit is so nice! 
+1	I loved the lights inside, and the fact they had stairs to go inside of it, so much safer in my opinion. 
+1	I love also, how you can sit on the edge if you want with your feet in the corn pit as you watch the kids. 
+1	The food and drinks are at a good reasonable price! 
+1	Medium size drink was like 2.50 that's a good price I'm my opinion. 
+1	Their are many many things you can so their. 
+1	For sure an all day thing! 
+1	I'm totally taking them back again soon. 
+1	Also it was nice having two train rides Now, especially when usually the train one is always long. 
+1	So yeah I am so happy and excited for new things they did! 
+1	So much fun!!!! 
+1	The rooms are clean. 
+1	The staff is helpful and friendly.

0	Told one of your other housekeepers , the one with the BLACK long hair , skinny.

-1	Second of all Sara my front desk assistant also thought I didn't understand and decided to talk about me to the other woman with the lip piercing .

-1	You need to get either A mature adults or B qualified and respectful workers. 
-1	And finally my bedsheets were all dirty and not changed properly . 
-1	There's was garbage shoved behind the MINI fridge. 
-1	You need to hire a better housekeeping supervisor or fix it.

-1	The breakfast made was chunky waffle mix that you guys made was not mixed well and not cleaned out. 
-1	The bathroom was leaking.

+1	Such a beautiful ceremony! 
+1	The banquet hall did an amazing job! 
+1	Staff was on point all night! 
+1	Bartender was very efficient!

-1	We found roaches in our bathroom in the middle of the night. 
-1	Breakfast was of very questionable quality. 
-1	I'm giving two stars because the staff were really friendly and helped as much as they could, but I'd say just opt for something else.
-1	Horrible customer service!! 
-1	We booked and got a hotel room and put our baggage in it and then when we came back there were OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR ROOM WITH ALL OUR STUFF IN IT!! 
-1	And they made us change rooms instead of telling them to get out of the room. 
-1	Now we have a flight to catch and they won�t recompensate us for their horrible services!

+1	The staff is courteous and helpful, and have responded quickly to my needs.

+1	The staff was friendly and helpful. 
+1	This hotel met my expectations for the price point. 
-1	I give them three out of five stars because it wasn't quite as clean as higher priced hotels I have stayed with.
+1	From first welcome, to final checkout the staff and management at this property demonstrate a level of customer service much appreciated, but not frequently enough experienced at other locations.  
+1	It is obvious from the manicured exterior, to the professional appearance and demeanor of staff, to the cleanliness of the rooms, to the presentation of the breakfast items that the aim of management and staff is complete customer satisfaction.  
+1	Located conveniently off major traffic arteries, this property is also close to shopping and restaurants and proves to be a comfortable and reasonably priced stop over.  
+1	Don't hesitate to stay there.
+1	Great staff.  
+1	Clean rooms. 
+1	Truck parking made easy.

-1	A  Saturday with no hot water paid for in full I could have stay home were the hot water was fine.
0	I had car trouble a couple blocks away and was having it fixed nearby.

+1	Booked months ahead on Expedia for a excellent price. 
0	Just off exit 5 on 1-94, but winding road with no street lights to get back to it off main street.

+1	Spacious room. 
+1	Free breakfast was very good.
-1	There's only one washer that HALF the time works (if you sit on it). 
-1	Also the front desk has a woman who is very RUDE to customers. 
-1	She ALWAYS has to argue or 'correct' you if she thinks you're wrong. 
-1	And always has an attitude. 
-1	I'd give no stars if I could. 
-1	DEFINITELY needs improvement on customer service skills and better maintenance on your laundry services.
+1	Megan and kyle are exceptional service staff. 
+1	They did a awesome job of making my stay as comfortable as possible even though i had a few issues with my own company. 
+1	They stayed patient and worked with me on everything

+1	My wife and I stayed here for a conference she was attending.

+1	The bed was comfortable. 
+1	Breakfast was good for hotel food, but the location, only a short walk from the stores and restaurants of Michigan Ave., was perfect.Stayed for one night.

0	Wasn't too bad once your nose adjusted to it though. 
+1	Staff was nice and friendly which is always a plus.
0	Here on reservations made by a friend of the family. 
+1	Fairly nice hotel, but one issue. 
-1	Our air conditioning unit has mildewed. 
+1	Aside from that, not bad
0	I recently stayed at the Candlewood in Merrillville, IN. 
0	Sadly, I was traveling for my father's funeral. 
+1	They knew this (as I was probably crying when I made the reservation), they actually called me while I was on my way driving out of state to find out my estimated time of arrival. 
+1	They wanted to make sure my room was available and ready prior to my arrival. 
+1	The manager and staff were so kind and considerate. 
+1	Even one of the cleaning ladies gave her condolences as I was getting onto the elevator one day.

+1	I also need to point out that they gave me a free upgrade to a full suite since the hotel was sold out due to outside events in the area. 
+1	The rooms were very clean, well kept, and very well up-to-date. 
+1	If given the opportunity, I will most certainly stay here again and will refer friends and family to you.

+1	Loved this place!
+1	Mostly good. 
+1	Room was pretty small but wasn't too cramped. 
-1	We had to wait over 10 minutes for them to get us another pillow. 
-1	When I asked for ear plugs at night they said they would send some up but when the guy came he only had a "sleep kit" which had a face mask, some tea, and a smelly oil, no ear plugs. 
+1	Otherwise service was very good everyone was nice and professional.
+1	The room was nice and clean. 
+1	Lots of little details that made our stay comfortable, like silverware and plates in room, microwave, as well as the free bottled water. 
+1	The attached restaurant was delicious and room service attentive.  
+1	Definitely worth what we paid
+1	If you're on a business trip, this would be an ideal hotel for affordable prices. 
-1	For a short weekend getaway this may not be the best option as everything around it is the financial district area. 
0	So weekend everything is closed. 
-1	No fridge in the hotel room is a deal breaker for young families with babies
+1	Location is really great, close to everything you'll need. 
+1	You can easily take the subway, rent a bike or even go walking to whatever place you want to visit. 
+1	Our room was clean, the size was acceptable and there was a pretty complete kitchen in there. 
-1	The Wi-Fi was not good though, there was no safe box in the room, the hotel does not offer breakfast and the lady who told us this was not kind. 
+1	Fortunately, you�ll find a Corner Bakery pretty close to the hotel, which offers great stuff for your breakfast for a pretty decent price. 
+1	Despite the mentioned lady, the hotel staff are friendly and the hotel is good.
+1	The staff was very friendly and very helpful. 
+1	Check in was super fast. 
+1	Room was a little outdated, but very clean.

+1	Would definitely recommend this place to stay. 
+1	A quick walk to different shops and restaurants. 
+1	Will for sure be staying here again. 
+1	The issue people might have with this place is their expectations. 
0	This is a hostel, not a hotel. 
+1	For a hostel, it is fine. 
+1	A nice neighborhood but with plenty of food options within walking distance. 
0	The rooms aren't anything too special but they do the job! 
0	I paid $66 a night for a private room with a bunk bed in it and that's all I needed, no more, no less. 
+1	Free breakfast was appreciated too. 
-1	The only issue is that the bathrooms are shared but they weren't particularly disgusting or anything. 
0	Keep in mind that this place always has lots of guests who are all using the facilities throughout the day. 
+1	Honestly the place is great for the price. 
0	Just understand what you're getting into. 
-1	Maybe bring an extra pillow if you need more than 1 since my room only came with 1 pillow per bed.
+1	The hostel is located in a very nice upscale residential neighborhood. 
+1	Free breakfast is included which consists of waffles, cereal, coffee and fruit. 
+1	Lobby and dining room has modern furniture. 
+1	Free computer use and printing by the main desk. 
0	Pool table costs $1. 
+1	The community kitchen is quite large and includes all the cookware and supplies you could possibly need. 
+1	There is community shelving for food and large fridges and freezers for guest storage. 
+1	A few vending machines are located behind the kitchen. 
+1	The patio looked great, spacious. 
+1	Bike rentals are available for $15 for 3 hours or $20 for the day. 
+1	Popcorn was available in the lobby. 
-1	Laundry machines in the basement. 
+1	Room was basic and clean. 
+1	Shared bathroom included stalls and locked showers inside private stalls. 
0	One hairdryer in the bathroom.
+1	Nice place, historical, cozy, multicultural. 
+1	You can bring your own food and cooking there. 
+1	Nice seating and relaxing area. 
-1	The beds can be improved. 
-1	More blankets in the rooms and a deep clean in the bathrooms. 
+1	Close to everything in town, you can walk and they have a parking available.   
+1	Going back again...Beautiful building. 
+1	Scary Shining like hallway, but fun if you know what I mean. 
+1	Staff is excellent. 
+1	Great knowledge of the area. 
+1	Great suggestions on what to do.I am here now and I will definitely return. 
+1	It is home away from home. 
+1	People are friendly, personnel is experienced and good. 
-1	Bathrooms are located a little bit far from our room, but they are clean and spact enough. 
+1	There were toilet stuff to share like shampoo etc. 
+1	In the evenings you can share a room with others and chat and play guitar or pool, or you can work with the computer. 
+1	Bikes are available for rent at a good cost. 
Breakfast is good and we walked to Cloud gate by foot, so it is not far.
+1	I strongly recommend it!
-1	$50/night valet mandated parking or $40/trip at the nearest lot...so we were told (didn't confirm) was a bit steep imo. 
+1	The valet were prompt, cordial, and available 24hrs.The room was clean and comfortable. 
+1	The bathroom was a nice size and clean as well. 
-1	We had a corner room which overlooked the parking lot and forced us to keep our blinds closed or give the neighbors an easy view. 
+1	The business room was quaint, but easily accessible and quiet. 
+1	They have a shuttle service and the driver was great. 
+1 	Very personable and altered his route to bring us closer to our location (it was raining). 
0	Ultimately, I would book this location again, although I would probably skip bringing my car there.
-1	First and foremost, my biggest piece of advice if you stay at this hotel is to call the local police if there is illegal drug activity and audible violent altercations on your floor.  
-1	We called security 3 times to address this exact situation as we tried to get sleep for our sick loved one in the hospital across the street.  
-1	Nothing happened, so if you'd like something done and you'd like to sleep, call the local police.
-1	Second, expect a lack of flexibility, empathy, and respect from most of the front desk employees/managers.  
-1	If you'd interested in an absence of security for your physical safety but an abundance of security for your Marriotts rewards points, this is the place for you.  
+1	One plus- the bartenders were very kind.
+1	Staff was friendly and helpful. 
+1	Rooms were clean. 
+1	Toilet ran until jiggling the handle, but otherwise everything was in working order. 
+1	Location was great for our conference at the UIC Forum. 
+1	Would recommend.If you are attending an event at the United Center this is the perfect place to stay. 
+1	They offer free shuttle service to and from the event. 
+1	The hotel was nice either a large bathroom. 
+1	The breakfast was very good but a little pricy but that may be typical for the city I'm not sure. 
+1	I would stay here again if going to the United Center.Expensive but very nice. 
+1	The front desk staff was extremely helpful. 
0	The only weird thing was the restaurant. 
-1	My husband went to get a Starbucks drink but it wasn't really a Starbucks drink. 
-1	Something on the machine quit working and the drink ended up being half of whatever it was supposed to be but he was still charged the full amount. 
+1	I will say, tho, they id try to make up for it the next day.This is a great hotel. 
+1	It had one of the largest gyms I have seen in a hotel in awhile. 
+1	Come on, they have battle ropes, in a hotel gym. 
+1	The service is good and find are pretty big. 
+1	Everything is clean and well maintained. 
+1	You can't ask for more in a hotel, and if you did I'm sure they would oblige you.Friendly staff and fully renovated hotel.
+1	The amenities that include the club lounge to the gym were amazing based on the location and legacy of the hotel. 
+1	The gym was about the size of one floor of the hotel which was great to see.I attended a conference here.  
+1	The rooms were clean.  
+1	The staff was quiet but friendly.  
+1	The food was good.  
+1	Water, tea, and coffee were always available.
-1	Rooms are nicely redecorated, but it's an old building and windows are not well sealed. 
-1	So even on a high floor street noise is very evident (and there's a lot of it). 
-1	Also, elevator noise could be clearly heard, even though I was three rooms away. 
-1	Also, AC unit was noisy and rattled. 
-1	Not a place for a light sleeper. 
-1	First room I was given had no hot water. 
-1	It seems incredible that the hotel would not be aware of this, did they think guests wouldn't notice? 
0	I called down and they said they would send maintenance up. 
-1	Didn't happen for a while and I had a meeting, so had to take a cold shower. 
0	Then the maintenance guy showed up, confirmed the problem and left. 
0	Later when I came back, nothing had been done, so I called back down and finally was given another room. 
0	Staff were trying their best, I think. 
+1	Every member of staff that I dealt with was friendly and helpful (except for that maintenance guy).
-1	No specific problems, but the room was in a state of needing some attention.  
-1	The grout around the shower valve was gone so it was flapping off the wall and letting the water run inside.  
-1	The fabric of the desk chair was ripped as well.  
-1	There were very few accessible outlets and no USB connection.  
-1	Not what I expect in 2017.  
+1	However, things were clean.
0	This hostel is ok. 
+1	It's cheap and is located near the Willis Tower. 
+1	You can easily reach downtown Chicago by foot. 
+1	The staff is friendly, too and the breakfast which is included in the price is totally fine. 
-1	The cutlery and coffee cups could be cleaner. 
-1	It is also not very cool that it isn't possible to lock the toilet doors and that the toilets and showers are in one room. 
0	But if you only stay there at night it's ok.
-1	Not very clean. 
-1	Super thin walls. 
-1	I couldn't sleep because of the noise from the bar three floors below. 
-1	No individual control over air conditioning. 
-1	Over-priced and they charge for everything. 
-1	They even charged $2 to watch my bag for a couple hours. 
0	I'm glad it was only two nights.
+1	Good location and price. 
-1	However, the two single bed room I booked had a couple Maintanence issues, including 2 electrical sockets with exposed wiring, the walls and ceiling are looking a little worse for wear, with some water and physical damage. 
-1	The first floor women's showers did appear to have a mold issue. 
+1	That said, I did enjoy my stay and would stay again.
+1	The rooms are roomy! 
+1	The breakfast is free! 
+1	The showers are very nice! 
+1	The Parthenon Hostel is the whole package. 
+1	Highly satisfied.
-1	Worst hostel ever. 
-1	Unfriendly staffs and misleading room sizes from description. 
-1	On top of that, they have only one Men's toilet for an entire floor. 
-1	There is always a queue in front of the toilet. 
-1	What an horrible experience for a group! 
-1	Breakfast is so poor as well. 
-1	You can get a cheap hotel with more amenities at the same price. 
-1	Feeling so regretful.
+1	Pretty good stay. 
0	It's a 3 star hotel so there are some cosmetic and function flaws (dresser drawers and closet doors that don't slide open or closed smoothly and a room door on which the deadbolt requires a trick to work) but the staff was friendly and helpful. 
+1	Bonnie (front desk) and Jesse (maintenance) were sweethearts, easily changing my room when I declined the one with the trick deadbolt. 
+1	I loved the room they moved me to. 
+1	Plenty of space. 
+1	The hotel is within walking distance of McCormick Place where the conference I was attending was being held. 
+1	Even better it had free parking!
-1	My one major complaint is that the cleaning staff isn't terribly thorough or especially good. 
0	Nothing was left dirty just less than neat. 
-1	They left one of my pillows on the floor after my first night there. 
0	I didn't realize I'd knocked it off and apparently neither did they. 
-1	And on another day they didn't replace the towels until evening when I was back in the room and the lady was knocking as she used her key to come in the room. 
0	Just really glad I was fully clothed. 
0	I'd stay here again but it would be dependent on the price and how close it was to where I needed to be.
+1	Nice hotel, good beds, big bathroom and the tub is huge. 
0	Seems like a decent area, but I'm in town for an event, so I haven't gotten out much. 
+1	Few blocks from an L stop that takes you to the north loop, so pretty convenient! 
0	There's a few parking areas, first come first serve. 
0	I checked in early, so there were plenty of available spots but it could fill up quickly.
+1	Awesome! 
+1	Loved the large rooms with refrigerators included. 
+1	Beautiful large bathrooms. 
+1	Front desk people very nice!  
+1	I liked it better than the Crown Plaza. 
-1	Some in my group did not like the parking situation which is an open lot.  
+1	Lobby nice too.
+1	Great hotel! 
+1	Loved the remodel. 
+1	Front desk was awesome and friendly. 
+1	Perfect location for our visit. 
+1	Free gated parking in back.
+1	The people who work here were nice. 
+1	They were good with turn down service. 
+1	The drinks at their bar were well priced. 
-1	My only knock is having to ask for extra face rags. 
0	Two people should get more two rags a piece. 
0	That and their "private" lot gate wasn't properly functioning when I arrived (they have a gated and more open lot; must have their parking pass to park in either).
0	All good other than.
+1	My friend and I visited Chicago to tour a film school, and when researching hotels before our trip we found Chinatown Hotel to meet all our requirements while still being quite cheap. 
+1	When we arrived we were not disappointed, everything was what we expected or better and the location of the hotel was perfect too. 
+1	5/5 would recommend.
+1	Decent location. 
+1	Easy access to trains and only a few stops from downtown. 
-1	Rooms were outdated, had very few features (TV with a couple of channels and A/C) and far from cozy. 
-1	The building is older so there is no elevator, which after a long day of walking was rough. 
0	I would stay there again if I couldn't find a deal downtown again.
+1	Great place to stay. 
-1	The rooms are small. 
0	If you are looking to stay in your room for your entire visit them it might be a problem. 
+1	Otherwise its close to lots of things. 
+1	The room was clean and bathroom clean. 
-1	There is no elevator so if you are on the 3 rd floor its 3 flights of stairs. 
+1	The staff is very nice and helpful.
+1	Looks better than expected and the rooms are rather comfortable. 
-1	Although the constant siren might be a slight annoyance at night. 
+1	All in all, location was the key of my choice.
+1	Cheap and affordable. 
+1	Great location in heart of Chinatown with close proximity to public transportation. 
+1	Very basic amenities but helpful and friendly staff.
0	We paid $250 for a Saturday night. 
-1	Not worth it! 
-1	The hotel was very noisy - sitting right next to the Train and with thin walls we could hear walking above and laughing and shouting into the night from next door. 
-1	The decor is very plain - robot monkey and train theme. 
-1	Drab grey. 
-1	Bathroom door would not close. 
-1	Worth the $78 for a week night but not worth over $100.
+1	PROS: Two rooms with a couch, historic building, proximity.
+1	Nice room, plenty of space. 
+1	Staff seemed friendly. 
+1	Bedding and towels were clean, as was the room. 
+1	Beds were nice and comfy, pillows we're in good condition. 
+1	In room refreshments seemed to be reasonably priced. 
+1	Rooms had soaps, shampoos, and lotion included. 
-1	Only downside was the enterance. 
-1	It just didn't feel very classy - felt like it was underground. 
+1	I would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend.
-1	The worst night ever in a hotel! 
-1	The air conditioners were very noisy. 
-1	Every train stopping at the Belmont station was loud enough to wake me. 
-1	And I was awoken in the middle of the night to discover that I had many (40-50 ) bug bites all over my body. 
-1	The room apparently was infested. 
-1	But don't worry, a brief visit to Urgent Care doctor and I am on the mend. 
-1	Though at the moment I just was to rip my skin off.
+1	Pros: Cozy, comfortable, close to the L, tons of awesome food spots within walking distance, great neighborhood, nice people.
-1	Cons: noisy air conditioners (but actually probably not much of a con as they drown out the street, train and other guest noise) laggy TV, so it probably should be a pro.)
+1	Positives: Location is great -- easy walk to Wrigley, and right by a transit/train stop. 
+1	The rooms are nicely sized, and the place definitely has a historic feel and some charming retro details. 
+1	Nice afternoon snack setup and light breakfast offered free daily. 
+1	Multiple excellent food options in the neighborhood. 
-1	Negatives: The radiators are very loud, clanking, woke us up a lot. 
-1	Ended up turning the dial to turn them all the way off, but that wouldn't be an option in the middle of winter. 
-1	The floors are also very creaky and there seems to be virtually no soundproofing between floors. 
-1	Our upstairs neighbors for the first two nights paced and paced and paced -- including in the middle of the night and very early in the morning (3-4am), making it difficult to get solid blocks of restful sleep. 
-1	The final night we were there, a new couple moved in upstairs and while there could be no doubt when they were having sex, at least it was a reasonable time  and they went to sleep afterwards, so we got some sleep finally. 
-1	Between the rads and the floors, we were pretty tired when we left. 
+1	However, I did not hear noise from outside the building, nor from the very nearby train. 
+1	I would probably stay here again, if I could be assured of a top-floor room. 
+1	This hotel was clean, comfortable and had a kind and attentive staff.  
+1	Go there.  
+1	It's awesome!  
+1	They care about their customers.
+1	We were a little skeptic at first...don't be! 
+1	This is a super clean hotel with great service! 
+1	Liz and Bryan were super nice! 
+1	The breakfast was amazing! 
+1	Not your regular (Holiday Inn, La Quinta...etc) out of a bag into the microwave breakfast. 
+1	They had meat,(thick bacon, not thin and microwaved) eggs, biscuits & gravy, potatoes, fresh fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, pastries... 
+1	The pool is simple and has a cute slide located in the somewhat center of the hotel. 
+1	The pool could be right out your back door if you choose. 
+1	The price is very reasonable! 
+1	The restaurant definitely gets ***** as well! 
+1	Hat's off to the chef! 
+1	The only thing I could say that was a little inconvenient was the smaller bathrooms, but it doesn't stop us from coming back!! 
+1	Great Job Clarion Inn owner/staff keep up the good work and lower prices!
+1	The rooms were very clean. 
+1	The restaurant has excellent. 
+1	The breakfast they served is one of the best offered by a hotel.
+1	Good overall dining experience.. 
0	A little wait for service. 
+1	But over all experience. 
+1	GoodComfortable just didn't like the room service food.
+1	This hotel is perfectly located in downtown Chicago within walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. 
+1	It was easy to find. 
+1	The staff was very accommodating. 
-1	The first night there was a slight buzzing noise in our room that we determined was the mini fridge. 
0	Since we didn't need the fridge they sent maintenance up to unplug it for us. 
0	We did not at first have enough wash cloths for two people in the room, but they brought us up some upon request. 
+1	There was coffee in our room, but each morning we took advantage of the lounge's coffee, tea, fruit and granola bars. 
+1	In the afternoon there was soda, candy and various trail mixes available. 
0	The bed in our room wasn't the most comfortable but was fine for two nights. 
+1	We also really appreciated the complimentary bottled water stations on each floor. 
+1	Overall, especially considering the price, we were extremely happy with out stay here and would definitely return.
+1	Excellent hotel downtown on the river. 
+1	It's conveniently located in downtown Chicago with great rooms and a great staff. 
+1	There is a restaurant in the hotel and everything is nearby. 
+1	You also have a view of the river in some rooms. 
+1	Definitely recommend for anyone in Chicago.
+1	Great location. 
0	Rooms are relatively small, but is enough.  
+1	Good service.  
+1	Water filling stations on the floors for bottled water.  
+1	Clean and comfortable beds.
+1	The staff here is the best!! 
+1	Nice free snack bar. 
+1	I will say don't love the beds there a little hard but other wise fabulous.
+1	Rooms were well furnished and comfortable, front desk was wonderful and helpful, restaurant service could have been better, valet was a bit understaffedAlthough I've stayed here before, this last visit was by far the best! 
+1	The room we had was very spacious, including the bathroom. 
0	The bathrooms are usually just big enough to accommodate each guest. 
+1	This one was big enough to sleep in if necessary. 
0	Plus it was not a handicap room!
Great staff who were accommodating, warm and not to mention the fastest check-in we've had at any hotel or motel. 
+1	The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was great with delicious and surprising additions to the standard Comfort Inn/SuitesIt was actually really good for the price even though we had four people and I ended up sleeping on a chair I still thought it was good. 
They had breakfast too Wich was pretty alright.

+1	Comfortable and clean room. 
+1	Good hot breakfast. 
+1	Friendly staff. 
0	Be careful if you use the pool area as the tile there is VERY slippery.

+1	During our countrywide roadtrip this turned out to be one of the nicest places. 
+1	Clean cozy rooms and good breakfast !
+1	It was really nice! 
0	I had my son's birthday party there. 
0	It was a pool party. 
+1	They were under construction or remodel but they were super great I couldn't use the breakfast room for cake and pizza so they let us use the pool room as long as we cleaned up after ourselves and one of the guys doing the remodel gave my son five bucks for his birthday which was really nice of him. 
+1	Super great stay and I'd do it again! 
+1	Awesome!
0	Concerned at first because of the carpet debris thrown into parking lot and in front of building, but they are just remodeling and making effort to improve the place.

0	That's about all you can ask for at these joints.

-1	The office style chair is absolutely atrocious and stain riddled.   
-1	Most of the switches in the room don't work.   
-1	The vent in the bathroom didn't work.   
-1	Refused to shower without flip flops on due to the mold riddled tub and needed to shower with the curtain open because the curtain was stained everywhere. 
-1	They could clean the rooms a little better, check the faucets to maje sure that the hot water is working in the sinkGo here if you want to have the most stressful time you've ever had at a hotel. 
-1	They steal your money, over charge and then lie about it. 
-1	Watch out for the stuck up 2 faced lying hotel manager.

0	I chose this hotel for my weekend stay because of its proximity to the camp. 
0	I got in late (after 11 PM).

-1	When I asked a question, her answer was very snippy. 
0	Didn't sit right with me at first, but then I shrugged it off. 
+1	However, the treatment I received from the two front desk employees the next day was nothing short of spectacular. 
0	The manager allowed me to extend my checkout by an hour, which I desperately needed. 
+1	That was very much appreciated! 
0	Additionally, when my Uber was late to pick me up, I arrived 4-5 minutes past my checkout time. 
0	I was in freakout mode thinking the hotel was going to require me to pay for another night in order to retrieve my belongings from the room (that is how it is done at most hotels). 
0	This was not the case! 
+1	The young man at the front desk said that was not necessary. 
0	He reprogrammed the key for me! 
+1	I never leave reviews, but I just had to commend these two employees for accommodating me as much as possible! 
+1	I would stay here again, for sure. 
0	I gave it 4/5 stars because of the first employee I interacted with. 
-1	Wasn't a big fan.
-1	I can honestly say this has been one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at.  
-1	Would not recommend it to anyone, ever.  
-1	Highly recommend not drinking anything they offer as every time myself and my friend that were there found stuff in our drinks especially the coffee with green fibers coming out of the pots.  
-1	The manager refused to talk to us over several issues that we had the few days we were there, and the entire staff was very rude about anything that you would need to ask about.  
-1	Cleaning staff didn't even attempt to clean the rooms as I found dirt in hair in the bathroom on the first night before using anything.  
-1	I wanted them to come in the second night and the same thing didn't even add toilet paper.  
-1	Myself and my friend ended up leaving early and switching to a different Hotel down in Bourbonnais. 
-1	It was absolutely terrible.  
0	Twice a year about 30 of us use this hotel to stay at...we do a collection show at the will county fairgrounds.  
0	We got there Saturday late afternoon and went for supper around 5.

0	At 915 the desk lady came out and said we had to go.    
0	We were all ok with it and started to move to our rooms.   
0	Nobody was out of hand or loud by any means.   
0	15 min later a police car showed up then another and another.   
-1	Told us the front desk lady had called and said we were loud and wild...my jaw about hit the floor.   
0	Well we went to our rooms but I went back to my vehicle about 10 min later.   
0	There was still a officer outside.   
0	We chatted some and he said he sat and wat he'd us for 15 min before they confronted us.   
0	He said he seen nothing wrong with what we were doing.   
0	UNREAL.       
-1	Come to find out the people that were there the night before we're loud and crazy sitting in our same spots ....the guy slipped the lady $100 and another $100 to the lady who came in for the night shift.     
0	It was ok then.     
0	They thought we would do the same for them.   
0	NOT.         
+1	We have been staying there 2 times a year for close to 10 years.   
-1	Not any more.     
-1	So next time u want to stay at this motel...make sure u don't sit outside and enjoy the evening without slipping them some cash.    
0	UNREAL.
+1	My family has stayed at this hotel many times over the last 2 or 3 years.  
+1	It has become our go to hotel when we are in the area.  
0	We stayed there this past weekend and we were very disappointed to know that our favorite manager Ms. Tracey as we called her, was no longer working there.  
+1	She always made my family feel welcomed.  
-1	Our last visit may have been our last visit to this hotel because of some of the bad experiences that  occurred during our stay.   
-1	The night manager was not very sympathetic  to our concerns about the plumbing issues, she offered to bring me up a plunger when the toilet overflowed!  
-1	Really???  
-1	once she came up with the plunger we still had to request that someone clean up the toilet water.  
-1	her response "let me see if I can find someone"....shortly after that someone came up to clean up the water with towels....the floor was NEVER mopped! 
0	I know it was 2:00 am but I think they could have at least brought in some kind of sanitizer.
0	Nice staff but, the hotel needs updating. 
-1	There were also stains on the drapes and one small stain on the bed spread. 
+1	Other than that my stay was pleasant.
-1	Initially, my husband and I were stressed because it was the only place with an available room and it was more than we intended to spend. 
+1	However, the wonderful service provided to us by the front desk clerk, Desiree, made the whole occasion worthwhile. 
+1	She was kind and friendly and she went above and beyond! 
+1	The room was also delightful, very clean and nice. 
+1	We forgot to mention non-smoking, so we did get out in the smoking section, but we really couldn't tell! 
+1	There was little to no smell of smoke. 
+1	It was incredibly comfortable, which is hard to find when travelling away from home. 
+1	Overall, we were highly satisfied with our stay, and are likely to stay again in the future.
0	I would give them a 1/2 star if possible. 
0	Only good thing was the coffee. 
-1	They have dirty, disgusting rooms. 
-1	I booked for a 3 week stay and this is what was in the room: dirty carpets(not vaccumed), hair in the bathroom on the floor and shower, coke or blood looking drips on the bathroom floor, trash on the floor between the beds and deodorant stick smashed on the floor next to bed, ac unit broken(ac stays on set at 64 degrees). 
0	I told the front desk and their solution is switch me room. 
-1	Okay so I'm on my new room and still unvaccumed carpets, hair in the bathroom, and trash not dumped from previous occupants. 
-1	Totally a dump here, they need to fire the cleaning people and hire someone who cares about their job. 
-1	Very disappointing, also the lobby had a under construction sign which I'm sure is older than a year because there was NO construction going on and obviously everyone complains of dirty rooms, so maybe they just want to keep the sign out there so it�s a good excuse. 
-1	Don't stay here, spend the extra money for another hotel!!!
+1	Staff and cleanliness was excellent !!! 
-1	However the pool was way too high in chlorine and was burning our eyes just being in pool area. 
0	It reacted our sinuses as well. 
+1	Other than fixing that everything else was fantastic. 
0	Just wish my kids and I were able to have some pool side fun.
+1	Absolutely wonderful place to stay. 
0	We went down for our sons navy graduation. 
+1	The staff is unbelievably kind and accommodating. 
+1	They changed our room twice for us no extra charge, gave us extra blankets, made sure we were happy with the change, our son left his phone in the room when we're changing rooms and they called me when we were at lunch and told me they charged it up and that it would be at the front desk whenever we got back. 
+1	Love, love this place and the staff. 
+1	Oh yeah... the free chocolate chip cookies all day were awesome as well!!!!

0	I expected some kind of meat for breakfast, sausages or bacon, but they did serve bacon and scrambled eggs the day we checked out. 
+1	Free breakfast 6-9:30am. 
+1	The area has lots of things to do. 
+1	Mall, restaurants , stores, gas stations, pretty much everything within a 10 mile radius. 
0	We went to Steak and Shake and order Mindy's barbecue which was very good, brought it back to the room,  matter of fact we went to Texas Roadhouse which is on the same property. 
+1	Its a nice place to stay for couple of days.
0	Stayed here while in town for a wedding.  
0	The room was fine.  
-1	Staff wasn't the best with passing along information or giving me the gift bag that was left for me by the wedding hosts.  
-1	It's also weird and inconvenient that there's only vending/ice on the 1st floor.   
0	Inconvenient at check out b/c "system was down" and they couldn't print my receipt, but I did receive it by email.  
0	Management did contact promptly regarding my feedback.  
-1	For the price, I would pay the extra $20 and stay next door at the Hilton :/Had my wedding block booked here. 
-1	Had agreed on one price with contract then when guests called to reserve if 2 people were in a room they were being charged an additional $10 which was not agreed appon. 
0	Had to call and give each guests name affected individually to get fixed. 
0	Then another guest called and they said there were no rooms available. 
0	But when I called on there behalf they suddenly found one. 
-1	Overall not the best experience for my wedding.
-1	This place sucks, was rated as a 3 star hotel on price line, lucky if it would rate as a 2 star.  
-1	Shame on you Price Line, you have lost a 25 years loyal customer.  
-1	Back to this crapy hotel, it seems like the gal at the front was more concerned about feeding her face and playing games one computer.  
-1	I'm actually thinking about checking our now and going to a hotel that cares about their customers.  
-1	Stay away from this dump.
+1	Awesome stay! 
+1	Hotel staff were amazing. 
+1	Bartender was fantastic (is it just me or does he remind you of Jess from Gilmore Girls?)!

0	My kids were able to make it work  and one chose the floor one night.   
0	Pool was small but nice.  
0	I did see some rooms that would share a wall with the pool.  
0	Not sure I would have liked that since pool is open 7a-10p. 
-1	Plus it was weird to have guest looking at us in the pool from their rooms.  
0	I would definitely ask for a room away from the pool (which is on the 10th floor).  
+1	The location is terrific  just steps from Michigan Ave. and close to Navy Pier, Red line train stop to Wrigley or transfer to orange line to airport.  
0	Price was higher than we would have liked but given the events in town plus Friday night stay all hotels were higher.  
+1	Very pleased and would definitely stay here again!
0	I was there for a training for work.  
+1	The customer service is wonderful.

+1	The rooms where spacious and the food fantastic. 
+1	I will definitely be staying there again soon. 
+1	This hotel was a block off of Michigan Avenue but it felt like it was on Michigan Avenue. 
+1	This allowed for a slightly lower price than some places on Michigan Ave. 
+1	The location of this hotel is absolutely superb for shopping and restaurants. 
+1	It was right next to Burberry and all of the fabulous stores that Michigan Avenue. 
0	There was construction going on but it didnt bother us. 
+1	The room was nice and spacious and the beds were very comfortable. 
-1	Only complaint is that the hotel staff called us twice in the middle the night claiming that we ordered towels and telling us that they were on the way, but we had not ordered towels and we were just woken up from our sleep. 
+1	Cannot stress enough how amazing of a location this hotel is in. 
+1	The parking was $47 for 24 hours which was relatively cheap compared to $60-$70 valet at other places. 
0	It was self parking however so I recommend not moving your car until you are leaving the hotel or else you will have to pay multiple times. 
+1	We will definitely be staying here again.
+1	Excellent location that is close to many bars and restaurants in River North. 
+1	Valet service was a breeze, check in was easy. 
+1	Rooms are clean, and quiet. 
+1	Lots of city noise from outside, but the hotel is literally in the center of the city, so I used the complimentary ear buds and slept very well. 
+1	Great stay.
+1	I wouldn't go back to Chicago if you paid me, but this was a nice hotel. 
+1	Very clean and professional. 
-1	The sauna room was a bit of a mystery though. 
-1	There was no way to put water on the coals and they appeared to be heated with electricity which is unnerving. 
-1	Definitely need to fix that.
+1	They had a barbecue available and a great balcony near the pool if you wanted to use it for a birthday or something like that. 
+1	I liked the pool even though it wasn't heated and i loved the hot tub which was freaking huge.
-1	All the hotels here are a rip off. 
0	Might as well go to one with a hot tub. 
0	That's what I think anyway. 
0	I was able to walk and uber to all the fun stuff.
+1	Staff was very nice and room was adequate as expected. 
-1	Lost a star as we found a dirty diaper "under" one of the beds as we were checking out. 
-1	Obviously didn't smell but if the room was cleaned before we got there plus between our stays, I can't help but question the thoroughness of basic cleaning. 
+1	Other than that, was a good stay.
0	Stayed here with two teenage boys while in town for a BULLS game.  
+1	The staff was super friendly, the room was clean and comfortable.

+1	My husband and I couldn't be more pleased with this Hotel. 
+1	Great friendly service from the ladies at the check in desk, the house keepers,  the staff at the door, etc.

+1	They are there to help 24 hours.
+1	Friendly staff and updated atmosphere.  
+1	Unique room set-up that made the room feel less like a standard hotel room.  
+1	Local police are present as security, so feels safer than the typical hotel.  
+1	Great location and friendly staff. 
0	Unfortunately, the room wasn't what i expected from a Courtyard. 
-1	The carpet had multiple stains on it and the door to the closet was missing. 
-1	It just seemed that the room should have been out of service until the room could be brought up to the standards one would expect of a Courtyard Marriott.Friendly staff and conveniently located. 
-1	My room was a little noisy and I had a large flying beatle in the room so not a great night of sleep.
0	Had my reservation 3 weeks before my stay. 
-1	Because of traffic I arrived an hour after my check in time only to find out that my room was not ready. 
-1	Still needed to be cleaned, which was done right away however the room was itself still dirty. 
-1	The venue I was going to, if I ever go back I'll find a nicer place a bit further away.
+1	Nice service. 
-1	Rough room.
+1	It is decent. 
0	It's not like best western or something.
-1	FIRST OF ALL THE MAN WHO ANSWERS THE PHONE WHEN U CALL DOES NOT LIVE IN THE STATE, that was the 1st sentence the Lady in the office told us.  
0	My husband and I needed a place for a week stay, we walked in with our 18 month old son, the lady said she had one room for someone with a child (the other ones had new carpet or was recently  remodeled) she gives us a key and points across the drive for us to check it out. 
0	My husband opens the door and wouldn't even let us walk in! 
0	The smell of cigarette and old dirty sex just BLEW out of the room! 
0	DISGUSTING! 
0	Obviously we drove away. 
0	Don't waste ur time driving out to that *H#%hole. 
+1	Mrs. Margo makes it worth staying here.
+1	My number one requirement for a hotel is that it be spotlessly clean which this was. 
-1	It had some oddities, though. 
+1	Room decor is on the plain side and a little dated but it actually suited my tastes, calm and relaxing. 
0	In the bathroom where you would expect to find a hair dryer, there is a telephone! 
-1	No hair dryer at all. 
-1	No in-room coffee maker or microwave. 
-1	Lovely plush bath towels but no hand towels or wash cloths! 
0	(Note: we later discovered the hair dryer on the far end of the shelf in the closet.  
0	If we hadn't noticed it by accident, we would never have thought to look there for it. 
-1	When I asked the front desk about hand towels and wash cloths, the clerk said sorry they were behind on laundry, but they'd get the towels to us soon. 
-1	We never did get any.)
0	Our balcony looks over a roof area with lots of noisy AC units, but if you look out instead of down, the view is nice. 
+1	The street looked really pretty last night in the rain. 
-1	Parking is a drawback. 
0	You either park quite a distance and walk blocks to the hotel or pay a whopping $49 per day for valet.

-1	Crazy. 
+1	Overall it's a good place and I would stay here again. 
+1	Excellent stay! 
-1	My room was a little warm for my taste.  
+1	But it was a great room. 
+1	Erick checked me in and he is a great representative for your staff.  
+1	After a long flight and a rough trip from the airport he made my day with his warm smile.  
+1	The Crowne Plaza will be the go to for my trips to Chicago.  
0	And this is why in an UGH member.
+1	Honestly the best I've EVER slept in a hotel. 
+1	Bed and pillow were very comfortable and it was quiet. 
+1	I thought it would be really loud but you couldn't even hear the other guests in the hallway or rooms next door. 
+1	Staff and valet were friendly and personable.
-1	The Crowne is still under construction, which means it's very difficult to get in and out of. 
-1	The only option is valet parking and it's crazy busy. 
0	The staff also seemed a bit overwhelmed with how busy it was Saturday evening/night. 
-1	Our first room we couldn't get into due to the key entry needing a new battery.

+1  Looked like adequate conference area. 
+1  Very professional atmosphere. 
+1  I feel safe and supported by staff and the accommodations.
+1  Quick check in, waited no more than 10 minutes. 
+1  Very accommodating staff. 
+1  Room was a double, what we asked for. 
+1  Everything in the room worked. 
-1  Maids could be a smidge more thorough. 
+1  Over all, pretty good.
+1  Nice place to stay! 
0   Didn't have a king room our first night there so they said to call down to desk the next day and they would get us our king room. 
0   We planned to be gone all day so called the desk first thing the next morning and asked of it would be possible to change rooms since we wouldn't be here at check out time. 
0   She said no problem we have a king room available right now. 
+1  Soon there was a knock on our door, front desk had brought us our new room key and even asked if we needed help moving! 
+1  So really nice people! 
-1  The downside was the tub didn't drain very well and our first room was too hot and our second room was just about too cold and we like it really really cold when we sleep so not sure what was up with that. 
0   You can change the fan speed in your room and not your temp just like others have said. 
+1  All in all it was a place we looked forward to come back to at the end of the day.
+1  The location of the Doubketree was ideal for me as I was needing to to get the airport the following morning. 
-1  The beds were comfortable, however the pillows, as seems to be standard with hotels, become flatter than pancakes within seconds of testing your head on them. 
+1  The room service was great and super quick - great selections to choose from. 
+1  The service was also decent - can't go beyond that as other than the chap that checked me in I didn't interact much with the staff.
0   Stayed one night. 
-1  Received a room with a dirty bathroom, but the lady at the front came to clean it so that was fine. 
-1  The room I stayed in smelled weird and had holes in the ceiling, but the room next door where my mom stayed was much nicer.  
0   Overall, it's exactly what you'd expect from a Place looks sketchy from outside, however the rooms have been remodeled.  
-1  It is $68 a night and I feel it should be a little cheaper for what you get.  
-1  I'd say $50 a night would be a more fair price.
-1  Very run down! 
0   If your on the run! 
+1  Lol, well it's perfect! 
-1  No WiFi! 
-1  It's just a place barely out of the rain!
+1  Outside looked scary, but the inside was clean and the service was great. 
+1  Bed was comfortable and the shower had plenty of hot water. 
+1  If you're just looking for someplace cheap to pay your head, this is it.
0   Just a place to stay! 
-1  Personally I wouldn't want anyone I know to even think I would stay there.
+1  Like most Embassy Suites, view inside is great! 
+1  Has full all you can eat breakfast in a comfortable atmosphere. 
+1  The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. 
+1  It's near the heart of downtown Chicago so lots to see within walking distance. 
+1  For other sights, it's only a Uber call away. 
+1  I recommend this hotel.
+1  The location is amazing. 
+1  The room was very spacious, and they gave free ear plugs if you are not adjusted to City noise. 
+1  Fantastic place.
0   Stayed at this hotel for the Labour Day weekend - 3 night stay.  
-1  Customer service at the front desk was terrible no matter who we talked to and the worst part was that the water pressure in the toilet was so low that the toilet wouldn't flush.  
-1  We had maintenance come out twice to look at it but they never fixed it!  
-1  Why pay $200+ a night to stay in a hotel where you can't even use your bathroom.  
0   Additionally, the hotel is literally right next door to a parking garage.  
-1  It sounded like dump trucks were coming through all the time and we heard nothing but car sirens at all hours.  
-1  When we asked to move rooms, they kept telling us they were full and to ask again tomorrow.  
-1  Lastly, the lobby has a beautiful fountain...that smells like mold and dirty water.  
-1  I definitely will not be staying at this hotel again and highly recommend staying at the Embassy Suites on magnificent mile instead.
+1  Our room was nice, clean, and well maintained. 
-1  Zero view from our room but that was on purpose. 
0   If you want a view you are going to be in a room on a busy street with a lot of street noise. 
+1  Our room was pretty quiet. 
-1  Two complaints, the shower head was mounted neck high for me. 
-1  It was on a hose which helped but still didn't like that. 
-1  The other problem was the TV/satellite signal kept going in and out. 
-1  This problem was not exclusive to our room. 
-1  The breakfast bar was nothing special.
+1  Very great stay. 
+1  The staff was helpful and upgraded my suite to a city view. 
+1  Excellent service all around the hotel!
0   Six of us stayed there for our annual girls� weekend and we are not easy to please.  
+1  The rooms were comfortable, spacious and the view of Lake Michigan was terrific.  
+1  The service was top notch.  
+1  A special thank you to Renee at the front desk who sent us a nice note with a bottle of wine and a plate of cheese.  
+1  The location was excellent too.  
+1  We would all highly recommend this hotel.
0   We stayed in room 1015. 
+1  It was exceptionally quiet. 
+1  We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. 
+1  Parking is confusing at first, but once you locate the Embassy entrance coming and going is easy. 
+1  The pool was nice as well. 
+1  The staff at the desk was helpful and friendly. 
+1  We will stay here again. 
-1  I would have preferred more water pressure in the shower, but it would not keep me from staying here. 
+1  The pull out bed was comfortable for our son. 
+1  We also loved the extra sink in the bedroom.
+1  The location is excellent. 
+1  It is within walking distance to shops on Michigan Avenue and Millennium Park area. 
+1  The staff were extremely friendly and the rooms were very clean. 
+1  They have a great happy hour where you get 4 free drinks each night from 5 to 7pm and they have snacks out. 
-1  They lost a star because they have satellite tv... which means when it's too windy or raining then you can't get any TV. 
-1  Considering thus is Chicago and they are right by the river, that doesn't seem very smart.
0   Small pool for hotel geared to families. 
-1  Slippery floor in the kitchen area where you went to get your breakfast. 
+1  We love the place. 
+1  Great location. 
+1  Great room / Suite. 
+1  Breakfast was very good.. excellent mattress.
+1  Very convenient location, couple blocks from Michigan Ave shopping one way, about half mile from Navy Pier the other direction. 
+1  Nice parking ramp and Whole Foods store across the street. 
+1  Rooms are very spacious and clean. 
+1  Great free breakfast. 
0   Stayed 2 nights with my family of 6. 
+1  Just what we needed. 
-1  My only tiny complaint was that while at breakfast, we were approached by someone trying to sell Hilton Honors program for discounted future stay rates. 
-1  Maybe a good deal, but felt awkward. 
+1  I only spent one night in this campground but it was fine for my needs.  
+1  It has a very peaceful lake and we had a spot overlooking it. 
+1  Lots of area for walking the dogs. 
+1  Water spiggots are high enough not to have to get on your knees to hook up. 
+1  Garbage cans throughout the park, which was convenient.  
+1  When I first called I didn't get a warm feeling from the woman on the phone, but when I got there the man was fine.  
0   I did find out that they have a dog weight limit of 15 pounds.  
0   We didn't get to that in our conversation until I was halfway through my reservation.  
0   They made an exception for me because I was just coming overnight, told her I'd arrive about 7, leave about 7 am and take the dog out once to potty in the evening and in the morning. 
0   She's a standard poodle and extremely well behaved and I actually have letters of recommendation for her from other places we've stayed just in case I run into issues with people not wanting to allow her. 
+1  Anyway, they did make an exception, and it all worked out.  
+1  It didn't look like there was a lot to do here, but that's the kind of campground I like, quiet with water. 
-1  One thing I will warn about, the state road getting to their property is extremely bumpy, possibly the bumpiest road I've been on, and then their very long driveway is also very bumpy. 
0   Make sure everything is especially well secured in your trailer.
0   We stayed there several years ago, but from reading the reviews, not much has changed.  
-1  The lady that owns the place is very unpleasant, but you can overlook that due to age.  
-1  However, the man that works there, (I think he is her son), is spooky.  
+1  Their website list their nature trails, and there are lovely trails through the woods.  
-1  He followed my husband and I on a walk one day and told us it was private property and to get off.  
-1  There were no signs, nothing that distinguished this trail from any other on the property.  
-1  My kids were afraid of him,  and he did seem to be always watching wherever you went or whatever you were doing.  
-1  The place itself is quite run down, and honestly,  kind of scary.  
-1  The laundry is only open during weird hours during the day so if you are there working you will not be able to wash your clothes.  
-1  Oh, and when you drive in their long rough driveway there are signs warning you to say on the road as they have put nails in the grass!!  
-1  Our stay was several years ago and we still talk about this place as easily the worst campground ever. 
+1  This is a great place to stay.  
0   Disregard the other negative reviews.   
+1  The host here is wonderful and sweet.   
+1  For example... my awning was torn in a storm and she replaced it.   
0   This was after her insurance told her that she was not responsible.   
+1  She still felt like she should help out. 
+1  That type of generosity isn't seen much these days.   
+1  I can't wait to stay there again!   
+1  Cheers!  
-1  They only allow dogs up to 15 lbs. 
0   Yes 15! 
+1  I enjoyed my time in this small RV Campground. 
+1  Nice Trails through green forest around the lake (water is overly green or I would give higher rating). 
+1  Love the geese, sunrises and sunsets in this quite park. 
+1  Poppa Don and the crew at Enchanted Shores make you feel like family & special guest all at the same time!  
+1  Whether you're entertained by an outdoor movie/football game or riding in the barrel train it's a great atmosphere to kick back and relax.
-1  Manager can't admit when he makes a mistake and will argue with you! 
0   They advertise wifi, showers, laundry and bathrooms. 
-1  They have NONE of it!!! 
-1  But they still charge the same as when they did. 
-1  They say they're repairing things but it's been this way for almost going on 3 years according to the campground staff. 
-1  The playground is unsafe for children also. 
+1  It is however good location for I-57, not too close but not too far. 
-1  Enchanted Shores Campground has no shores to speak of.  
-1  What they do have, is plenty of noise from the traffic that runs along both streets bordering the corner campground.  
-1  There was no picnic table, the fire ring was in the neighbor's lot, there were very few trees for shade, and the noise from the traffic went on all night.  
-1  I would never recommend staying there.
0   Stopped by today to see what was there and if I wanted to bring my camper there. 
0   I didn't stop at the office because the sign said it was closed. 
-1  I thought maybe there was some sort of lake or pond there because of the name enchanted shores, but that was false. 
-1  There's nothing there but a run down trailer park. 
-1  Then I was run down my the manager( I guess), who was all upset that I didn't stop at the closed office. 
-1  Very rude and unfriendly. 
-1  I'll never go back again. 
-1  The place is a dump anyway.
0   The park itself was alright. 
-1  The management I found rude. 
-1  I was stopped in my car, a man yelled at me to stop. 
-1  When the man approached my window he didn't announce who he was not even a simple hello. 
-1  He just says can I help you. 
-1  When I told him no and that I'm staying here he proceeded to ask me when I arrived, who I was, and where I was staying in the park in a rude tone. 
-1  Mind you he still hasn't told me who he is so of course I'm giving vague answers to a man that just randomly stopped me in my vehicle.
-1  He made me feel unsafe and uneasy. 
-1  He finally did reveal he was one of the managers of the park  he didn't tell me his name or anything. 
-1  Just that he is a manager and said he didn't recognize me and than just left no bye no nothing. 
-1  I found it extremely rude to stop someone in their vehicle and not even announce who you are and than some.
+1  The price was reasonable and the bed was comfy enough. 
-1  There were no ice cube trays in our freezer and they don't have an ice machine, so getting in late didn't allow us time to get trays and fill them and wait for ice to form before having a drink at bed time. 
-1  The microwave had not been cleaned and had mold growing on it. 
-1  There was also a centipede in our room. 
+1  The staff were very friendly and helpful and everything else was clean. 
-1  More could be done to easily improve the quality of this hotel.
-1  I second guess the cleanliness of the hotel. 
0   We stayed here one night for a wedding. 
-1  There was scuz on the walls in the bathroom, our microwave was filthy and had a huge hunk of moldy food stuck to the rotating plate. 
-1  Fridge had food boogers in it too. 
-1  We didn't use it so it wasn't that big of a deal but still pretty gross. 
-1  No convenience of ice machine, plates, sliver wear, pots or pans. 
-1  They had one staff member running the front desk so they couldn't deliver anything to our door so, we had to run down to get anything we needed. 
-1  When we booked the hotel it said Continental breakfast but it was only coffee and muffins. 
+1  The staff was friendly. 
+1  The air conditioner worked. 
+1  The bed was comfy. 
-1  Those the only good things i can say. 
-1  I was very disappointed and don't think I'll be back.
+1  Management and staff was very friendly and accommodating. 
+1  Room was clean, bed comfortable, amenities provided, free WiFi, nice channel selection and location perfect. 
+1  Kudos for the quietness even though they allow pets. 
+1  Fresh smell throughout hotel!!!
+1  The room was awesome, good size room with microwave, fridge, stove top and even silverware which was unexpected. 
-1  We did however have to wait about 15-20 mins for someone to show up at the desk. 
-1  Not awesome after a 10 hour drive.
-1  This hotel is located as such that it is not easily spotted from the highway. 
-1  The staff is friendly, but the service wasn't very impressive. 
-1  We had a room on the second floor that had a kitchenette which was OK but there wasn't anything in the room for cooking, eating and drinking. 
0   You have to ask at the desk. 
-1  They don't offer amenities so be sure bring your own! 
-1  They might have a small bottle of shampoo and bar soap (which smelled horrible). 
-1  Overall, I was not impressed.
+1  This is a very nice hotel for an overnight stay. 
+1  The rooms are clean and what you would expect from a Marriott. 
+1  The staff was very helpful and friendly. 
+1  The breakfast area was large and there was a good variety of items. 
+1  Would definitely return.
+1  Room was clean and tidy. 
+1  Bed was comfy and the shower better than expected. 
+1  Staff were all friendly and courteous. 
+1  Even with brewing convention attendees staying in the hotel, it being by a highway and railway line it was quiet and peaceful. 
+1  Would happily stay again if in the area.
+1  Clean rooms. 
+1  Friendly staff. 
+1  Convenience of being right off the interstate however be aware that you can somewhat hear the interstate traffic. 
0   But not really much the hotel can do about that, to be fair. 
+1  I would recommend this hotel. 
+1  Close to the casinos and they have a shuttle.
-1  Bed was comfortable but the room had an unusual smell to it. 
-1  Wasn't overpowering but noticeable. 
+1  Staff was friendly and pricing was reasonable.
+1  My room was not initially provided with a spare sheet and blanket for the futon, but the staff quickly provided me with the items when asked. 
-1  The blanket did have a hair on it that did not resemble mine. 
+1  The room and complimentary breakfast were both very nice.
0   I took  about 10 black girls (my daughter and her friends) to the Fairfield Inn Tinley Park, IL Marriott Hotels.... 
0   We were there for about ten minutes when management came to the room. 
-1  They asked us at what time did we plan on not making any noise.  
-1  I was a little confused.. because the girls were not making any noise.  
-1  I asked management did they ask everybody who came in that question or if it was just us.  
0   Mind you I had 3 rooms more that enough to accommodate us.  
-1  Needless to say I left the hotel to take the kids to the mall only to receive a call that I had to checked out and come get my stuff and that police had been called.  
-1  They also informed me that I would still be charged for the rooms in which I had only checked in and been put out.  
-1  It was discrimination at its finest....
+1  Loved the rooms and loved the breakfast and also loved the staff. 
-1  My only complaint is one that I know doesn't effect a lot of people but I really wish there was a better fitness center. 
0   I understand this isn't a popular topic but for someone like me this is a big deal. 
-1  There were two treadmills that didn't incline, an old elliptical, and a few dumbbells. 
-1  Would have five starred if there was even two more pieces of equipment.
+1  Very clean and nice hotel. 
+1  Staff was very polite and the area around the hotel was nice with lots of food choices around. 
+1  I'd definitely stay here with my family.
+1  Nice basic hotel, clean, updated, Paul Mitchell tolitries, comfortable beds. 
+1  employees are helpful and friendly.  
+1  Room was nice size with large couch, that pulled out to bed, large desk, 2 TVs, small microwave & fridge.  
+1  Easy to get to/from Hollywood Casino Ampetheater.  
+1  Several restaurants within a couple blocks, easy walk.
+1  Great quality rooms...always clean. 
+1  The setting is very quiet so you won't be disturbed. 
+1  Free breakfast! 
+1  Free WiFi (though it is quite slow)
+1  I spent 5 days here and I enjoyed myself. 
+1  All the staff were wonderful but for me Jerome at the front desk was the best! 
+1  He helped me so much! 
+1  He went above and beyond and out of his way to accommodate me and feel welcome. 
+1  He is awesome! 
+1  Jerome gets an Atttttt in customer service.
0   Where do I begin with this place! 
+1  They are amazing from the front desk to every staff member in the place. 
+1  I teach Knock your socks off customer training classes and I would think they had my class lol. 
+1  Anyway this is the best place to stay in Merrillville, IN. 
+1  They made my trip so much more enjoyable. 
+1  Clean, Caring, the warm cookies, good breakfast, and they have fresh water for you all night with lime. 
+1  If you stay here you will not be disappointed. 
+1  Oh don't let me forget the heated pool! 
+1  Thanks again Fairfield Team!
+1  Fairfield Inn was easily located right off the highway in an area with a lot of restaurants, gas stations, shopping, and other big city feels in a small town environment. 
0   We were traveling as a family for a professional event in the area. 
+1  We felt it was safe and family friendly. 
+1  The service was quick and friendly. 
+1  The room was newly renovated and comfortable. 
-1  Our room had two full size beds which are smaller than what we are used to (we have usually seen queens). 
+1  For our little family it worked fine. 
+1  The breakfast was nice and included hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, fruit, cereal, waffles, yogurt, assorted drinks, and a coffee bar. 
0   There is an outside pool, however it wasn't open yet, but we stayed the first weekend in June and the weather hadn't been warm enough. 
+1  Nice, clean place. 
+1  Would stay again if in the area.
+1  I rented a suite my 3 sisters, mother & myself enjoyed our stay very much! 
+1  The staff is awesome they were very accommodating and helpful. 
+1  The rooms we very clean.... 
+1  I will definitely staying there again! 
+1  Nice clean and friendly staff has a washer and dryer continental breakfast was good
+1  Top top top notch staff.
-1  But terrible room conditions.  
-1  Room reeked of smoke and the bed was way too soft for my taste on the first try.  
-1  Asked for another room and they accommodated (although had to go from King to dual queen) and the room was better but one could still tell it was old.
-1  Due to the building's condition alone, I'd urge long stay travelers to avoid.  
+1  However if you're judging solely on staff, I'd give it 5 stars.
0   Traveling with senior citizens on this trip. 
+1  Check in was quick and easy. 
+1  Drop off and entry to hotel easy. 
+1  Rooms were spacious enough and clean. 
+1  Breakfast was adequate. 
0   This was a travel business stop. 
-1  Certainly acceptable, very clean, but an older worn out Fairfield.  
-1  Hospitality was nice, but not overly friendly.  
-1  A place where you had to ask, not going out of their way to make your stay enjoyable.
+1  Great customer service nice clean rooms beautiful pool area to relaxing with jacuzzi would recommend it and go back again
+1  Great service, great breakfast, great quality room. 
+1  Felt like home. 
+1  There was a lot of stores around it to stay busy.
0   I have been staying at this hotel for a while as a business guest. 
+1  The recent remodel has freshend up the look and feel. 
+1  While not a 5 star hotel, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and always make you feel welcome. 
0   I always stay at this hotel when in Kankakee.
+1  Nice hotel. 
+1  Check-in was very nice and rooms clean. 
+1  Breakfast was better than average and the entire package at a reasonable price.
+1  Location isn't the prettiest town, but inside the hotel is amazing. 
+1  Room looks great and they are currently doing renovations to make the hotel even better. 
-1  Hot tub was not working so that was a disappointment, but the pool is still up and running. 
+1  Overall great place.
+1  Great location and clean rooms. 
+1  Friendly staff and comp breakfast.
+1  Nice for the area. 
-1  But it's a very monotone theme.
+1  Our room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. 
0   I would definitely recommend paying the extra $ to get access to the breakfast and snacks in the gold club during your stay. 
+1  We got our money's worth of snacks, that's for sure. 
+1  The breakfast was killer. 
+1  I had bagels with lox every morning of our stay and it was heavenly.  
+1  The hotel is centrally located in downtown and within walking distance of the train to get to the airport. 
+1  I would highly recommend this hotel!
-1  Bed was a bit hard for my taste, and the pillows are those old-school feather pillows, which provide no support whatsoever. 
0   Abroad, most hotels offer internet for free. 
-1  People who come to the Fairmont will be surprised on how much they have to pay. 
-1  Place is a bit secluded from major streets. 
-1  Not really sure what is driving the high premium. 
0   $655 for two nights? 
0   Good luck, mate.
+1  The hotel is in a tremendous location. 
+1  It has great views of the city and is extremely well-kept. 
+1  My experience here was to visit a conference and attend some meetings and a suite that was reserved for us and it was really nicely located and done.
0   We are big fans of the Fairmont Seattle, and this was our first introduction to the Fairmont Chicago. 
+1  We had a great view room overlooking the park. 
+1  Service was fantastic, as always. 
+1  This is a great location: just a block to the waterfront parks. 
+1  Our three year old enjoyed both the hotel and nearby playgrounds. 
+1  Recommended!
+1  My lady friend and I spent six nights at this excellent hotel and enjoyed it tremendously. 
+1  Although the hotel could use some updating, our suite was  clean and lovely, with wonderful views of Lake Michigan and the park, and the hotel's location is outstanding. 
+1  In particular, the Concierge staff was fabulous, tending to our requests with enthusiastic response. 
+1  This was my first return to my native city in 30 years, and the Fairmont Chicago made it extremely enjoyable. 
+1  Thanks!
+1  Great hospitality! 
0   Which is hard to find these days. 
+1  We stayed at Super 8 the night prior and paid what we had paid for two nights there very affordable. 
+1  And after staying at Super 8 we were worried about the environment from our experience at Super 8 but it was terrific nice quiet no complaints we actually felt safer there than we did at Super 8 thank you for the terrific stay
+1  Very good customer service. 
0   They are constantly renovating. 
+1  Some rooms are brand new. 
+1  Very friendly people and quite place to stay.
-1  If you come to the Family Inn expecting the stereotypical hotel feel of today's society this is not the place for you. 
+1  But if you want a vintage experience that takes you back to the family road trip vacations of the past then you are in luck with this place. 
+1  The owners are a wonderful couple that accommodated us when we had to come to the tiny town of Watseka unexpectedly for a family funeral with a tight budget. 
+1  They even called the morning after our first night to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed. 
+1  While the rest of my family set up at the run of the mill Super 8 just down the street for $80 a night,  my kids and I got to experience the historical, old time feel of real hospitality at the bargain price of a two night stay for $100. 
+1  I have a lot of family in this area and this will be our home away from home every time we have to come into town. 
+1  The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I don't want to give people unrealistic expectations because of some of the conditions of this historical building, but we were comfortable and felt very safe here.
+1  If you are looking for old time courtesy and customer service then FAMILY INN, Watseka must be the choice. 
+1  The property is old no doubt but the manager couple surpassed our expectation of good service with flying colors.
+1  Our room was basic but very clean with nice soft linens. 
+1  Bed was firm and comfortable.
+1  With room rates so low - 70is and 80is era! 
+1  - there is nothing to write bad about our experience. 
+1  Will recommend them in a heart beat!
0   Room was ok bed was very clean shower only got warm not hot but not a bad place for 45 bucks +1  Stellar. 
+1  Beautiful corner room with awesome view. 
+1  Treated my kids like royalty. 
+1  Staff was superb. 
+1  Perfect location...steps from Michigan Ave. 
+1  Treat yourself!!!
+1  It was a wonderful stay as always.  
+1  Staff and service was great..Food was high quality and presented so nicely from room service.  
+1  I always stay at this hotel for all these rreasons!!
0   If anyone is looking for a great deal on hotels you can check it out on HotelRaven.com 
0   Booked a room on there and they had the best rates around...
+1  Nice hotel in the middle of magnificent mile. 
0   The hotel itself is a bit dated compared to some of the other five star hotels in Chicago, but you won't be able to tell the difference. 
+1  The views are spectacular, make sure you get a room facing the lake!
0   $7.00 for a glass of milk, because my wife felt ill and needed to take a pill. 
-1  Took the nearly full glass of milk back to the bar, and the bartender told me he couldn't change the prices. 
-1  A nice guy would have just given me a glass of milk. 
-1  There's such a thing called manners and friendliness. 
-1  You have none....
+1  Expensive but amazing.
