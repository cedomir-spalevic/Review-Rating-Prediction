Restaurant Training
+1	Fast seating, fast, friendly service. 
+1	Servers were all fun and talkative. 
+1	It was Sweetest Day and they were giving single long stemmed roses in various colors to all ladies, even little girls got roses! 
+1	The food was fresh, good quality and came out nice and hot. 
+1	The only issue was each course came out quickly, so we didn't have time to enjoy our appetizer before our salads arrived and again with our entr�es. 
+1	Everything was clean, including the ladies room.
+1	The best Cajun food ever!  
+1	Red beans and rice delicious! 
+1	Huge screens to watch games on.  
+1	Several bars within this huge place. 
+1	Luv the patio seating and great service.
0	Haven't been there in about 8 years give or take... 
+1	Although much has changed inside the memories and amazing fun are still there. 
-1	They could use some nicer bartenders though I'll tell you that but other than that I recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun night out.
+1	I want to thank KAYLA, our waitress, so much for making my mom�s retirement party one of the best parties we ever had yesterday! 
+1	Kayla knew exactly when to come over and check on us, and what to recommend when we asked for some specialty drinks or cocktails that weren�t exactly on the menu. 
+1	They didn�t have any banana liquor for BBC, but the vanilla liquor worked out perfect instead, and it was a hit among several guests, including my mom! 
+1	She and the other gentleman were on point with making sure everything was going okay so far while the time passed by waiting for more guests, and then making sure everyone was taken care of after all of the guests had arrived and the clock struck 3.
+1	I don�t recall ever having service quite like what we had for a long time around here! 
+1	Kayla definitely deserves a promotion for her outstanding work, her professionalism, and how personal she was with everyone. 
+1	Thank you Bourbon Street, and thank you Kayla! 
+1	We will return for any parties we host in the future, and recommend 115 Bourbon Street to all of our friends, guaranteed!
+1	Nice place.. 
-1	Just always to crowded for my liking. 
+1	All though I do always have a good time here! 
+1	Seen OAR here and the sound was pretty good for a bar. 
+1	Great place to see a band up close and personal.
0	Arrived at Three Floyds with low expectations due to some of the recent reviews. 
+1	However, my party and I had a decent evening with quick friendly service. 
+1	Our food was delicious and our server was happy to bring us samples of the many beers we wanted to try.
-1	Music is loud so be aware 
+1	Food menu is great.
-1	Only issue was wait we arrived on a rainy day were asked to wait outside "in the rain".
-1	Appeared to have open tables Was told  45 min wait turned into 10.????
0	Almost seemed that they wanted us to go elsewhere NOTHung around and had an enjoyable experience
+1	Love this place.  
+1	Service has always been excellent with passionate waiters and waitresses.  
+1	Food is really good,  if the menu is small.  
+1	Take home some jerky!
+1	Tucked away in an industrial park, three floyds is probably the best/most interesting food in the area.  
+1	Food gets high marks for creativity but execution is sometimes lacking, but that doesn't matter because you're in northwest Indiana.  
+1	Obviously the beers are great and they have many offerings from other microbreweries as well.  
-1	For some reason I don't want you to bring your kids here....
0	Walked up to eat in the tap room.  14 groups deep. 
0	No problem, we�ll get a beer at the bar. 
0	Woops. 
-1	We were promptly told to GO WAIT IN OUR CAR because they don�t allow that.  
-1	What? 
-1	Never coming here again.
+1	Amazing sushi, fantastic service! 
+1	Everything is at a great price and you get plenty of food. 
+1	Ask for Roy - he's a wonderful server and is great to chat with!
+1	good chine food happy people .. 
0	just fish tank litte by more clean up ...
-1	Our dishes and utensils were dirty. 
-1	The food wasn't as good as expected. 
-1	Maybe we went on a bad day.
+1	Never had a bad experience. 
0	I have had delivery and dine in. 
+1	It's generally a good experience and the food is always good.
+1	Great food with impeccable service! 
+1	I have been to this place multiple times and was never disappointed. 
+1	And their price is reasonable.
0	This is a review for the bar menu. 
+1	We arrived around 5:30pm on a Friday and had no trouble getting a seat. 
+1	The two standout dishes of the evening were the Connecticut-style Lobster Roll and the PB+J-inspired dessert. 
0	We tried the bar tasting menu, which included canapes, egg yolk ravioli with truffles, roast quail with savory bread pudding, and the PB+J-inspired dessert. 
0	We also ordered the cauliflower dish and the famous Acadia hamburger.
+1	I would come back in a heartbeat for the buttery and delicious lobster roll, and we also left with the impression that the pastry chef is very talented. 
-1	Outside of those dishes, however, we were disappointed by the execution and felt a little surprised that Acadia has two Michelin stars. 
-1	Many of the hot dishes arrived cold and tasted like they weren't seasoned carefully.
+1	The service overall was excellent. 
-1	Our waiter did forget to light our candle after we asked him about it, but of course that was a minor detail. 
0	I think the Michelin stars carry so much mystique that we noticed those little details more than we usually would.
+1	Excellent service and great food! 
+1	Honestly this restaurant met my expectations but did not exceed them. 
0	It is what you would expect from a Michelin starred restaurant but does not go beyond to really revolutionize the art of food. 
+1	Overall, if you want to eat great (Michelin starred) food then it is a good place to get started (given the strong/bold flavors are very subtle), but that is it. 
-1	There are other amazing places where the food can really 'blow' your mind. 
+1	Great service, presentations and delicate food but not the best taste. 
0	We did 9 course plus 3 supplement courses. 
0	We spent close to 400 per person and with this kind of money I expect the best from every aspect. 
-1	During this trip I visited 3 Michelin starred restaurant and Acadia was not the best one. 
-1	I wish they can work on the flavor so it can match up with their presentation. 
+1	Good experience in overall but won't go back for a while.
0	Sat at the bar. 
+1	The burger was very good. 
+1	The environment is nice and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.
+1	One of the best restaurants in Chicago (Michelin starred). 
+1	Terrific chef and great service. 
+1	Very inventive tasting menu. 
+1	The bar serves light food that comes from an amazing kitchen - worth trying. 
+1	A must try in Chicago as it is a foodie destination
+1	Great experience, pleasant employees. 
+1	Clean eating area.  
+1	The new turkey sandwiches are great.
-1	Deep fat fryed turkey not as good as original beef or ruben
-1	Placed sucked food not warm and not cooked good at all. 
-1	Well never go back.
+1	Excellent service today. 
+1	Good very good.
-1	There's absolutely no consistency here onetime you go there it's awesome the next time you go there you swear they just went and bought the roast beef from Walmart. 
0	No offense to Wal-Mart
0	When is a burger better than the sum of its parts? 
0	That's the question I've been asking ever since I ate at Au Cheval. 
0	Nothing extraordinary stands out when you first see the burger. 
0	Simple patties, cheese, sauce, without the bacon and egg it's really pretty standard. 
+1	Even so, once you take your first bite you realize that the flavors all compliment each other so perfectly that you can't find any faults. 
+1	Nothing leaves you thinking "that could have been a little better". 
0	You'll find yourself eating slower as your realize the inevitability that this burger you've now grown attached to will run out. 
0	You take smaller bites, trying to procrastinate  further by ordering another beer or another round of fries but still the burger gets smaller. 
0	As that last bite sits on your plate, gleaming below the harsh light in an otherwise dark restaurant, you have to make a choice. 
0	Eat it and accept that it's over, or leave it as the ultimate display of respect. 
0	I chose to leave it; my way of saying "see you later" rather than "goodbye". 
+1	What an amazing burger.
+1	The burger was truly the best cheeseburger I�ve ever had. 
+1	Just so full of fatty flavor. 
+1	The bacon on top is a must - and the fried egg, too. 
+1	French fries were thick and salty, and the aioli was flavorful. 
+1	We also split the porterhouse four ways and it was so so good. 
+1	The sauce was �Thanksgiving-y� as someone put it, but the meat was really fatty and fell off the bone. 
+1	Drinks were refreshing and tasty (favorites were the pink vodka lemonade and the secret brew). 
+1	Waitress was super friendly and very helpful.
+1	Basically everything was made of high quality, fatty ingredients. 
+1	Best American food I�ve had.
+1	Came here for a post Marathon meal and was not disappointed. 
+1	If you�re a couple or flying solo would recommend sitting at the bar. 
+1	You�re able to watch this very talented crew create burger after burger brilliantly.
+1	Even though they have an extensive beer and wine list we focused on the cocktails. 
0	Began with a pickle back (whiskey and a shot of pickle juice) followed by a Hemingway Daiquiri, Bees Knees and Old Fashioned. 
+1	The list is their take on classics which all went down perfectly with our food.
+1	If it�s your first time here and you�re hungry, highly recommend the double. 
0	It�s three patties, cheese, minced red onions and a delicious sauce. 
0	It comes with a knife in it which I promptly used to saw this beast of a burger in half. 
+1	The bread and butter pickles are fantastic and their fries are not to be missed. 
+1	You will walk out of here completely satisfied.
+1	Delicious burger, amazing fries, but over hyped.
0	I really wanted Au Cheval to be my favorite burger place. 
0	I wanted to have a religious experience that would force me to drag my out of town friends here. 
+1	However what I found was a delicious burger (get the egg and bacon) and awesome fries.
-1	It was incredibly difficult to get a table. 
-1	They have one line which forms for both people that have a table ready and for people looking to add themselves to the wait list. 
-1	This causes confusion and would be better setup as two lines, perhaps add people to the wait list outside and people that have a table ready go inside?
-1	Our wait ended up being about an hour which wasn't the worst I've seen, but it's still a long wait considering you can get excellent burgers elsewhere in the city without waiting.
+1	Overall I'll come back someday. 
-1	However this isn't going to be a regular spot for me.
+1	Best burger in the USA IMHO. 
+1	It's a heavy burger, add get the egg and pork belly and you are in burger heaven. 
+1	I bring everybody who visits me there and so far everybody agrees. 
-1	There is always a wait, but if you go alone or as a pair you can get in a lot faster otherwise around a 45 min wait. 
0	The small Au Cheval does not compare. 
-1	They don't even have their signature pork belly and egg option.
0	This review is for the Chicago location. 
+1	The Ambiance is nice but modern. 
+1	The pizza is excellent, with a sweet sauce and a salty cheese. 
+1	It is the best thin crust pizza that you can get. 
+1	I have been eating it for 35 years. 
0	I was a busboy and their Homewood location in the early 1990s.
0	Had the super six the works. 
+1	Definitely among the top 5 pizzas I have ever tasted. 
+1	Can't remember any that were better. 
0	Ask for the old oven. 
0	It is a brick oven about 75 years old so the pizza taste is baked into every brick. 
+1	DELICIOUS!!!!!
-1	We were a group of 16+ and 4 high chairs on a Sunday at 1230pm( we reconfirmed the advance notice 2 times earlier in the week) and although the restaurant was mostly empty, we were put at 2 cramped tables in a corner with 4 completely empty tables next to us. 
-1	After waiting to be acknowledged by a server then waiting again for pitchers of water, we had to flag down the waitress for beverage service. 
-1	While waiting on our beverages, the hostess approaches our group to request that we remove our items from the empty table next to us as they need the tables -reiterating that we were assigned 2 tables,  not 3- this is long before we were even given the opportunity to place a food order. 
-1	90 minutes later the empty tables next to us that were so urgently needed were still not occupied. 
+1	Aurelios pizza is the best in the area, but the customer service definitely needs improvement. 
-1	I plan several events in the area but unfortunately would not recommend this Aurelio's for group events.
0	Most people think of big deep dish pizza when they think of Chicago Style.  
0	Not me, this is home, this is Chicago style pizza for me.  
+1	The best crust, sauce toppings in the area.  
+1	The Homewood location has the best atmosphere and is truly the home of sit down family pizza.  
+1	It is pricey but worth it.
-1	Server Was the rudest woman that I have ever come across and she snatches things from your hands and don't allow you to ask a question without saying that lunch specials were over. 
-1	Wasn't offered anything regarding lunch and when the order was ready to be placed could not find her. 
-1	Poor time management skills and customer service consideration too. 
-1	First time visiting and will be the last. 
-1	No One had any manners or consideration for other people then themselves. 
-1	Too much time spent on personal conversation.
+1	We've always loved Aurelios. 
+1	I grew up going to the original one in Homewood and now so very happy to have one basically in my backyard.
+1	As usual the food was good, but we stopped at 1230 for the buffet,  we are vegetarian, and to wait 30 minutes for a cheese pizza. 
-1	We could have just ordered our own at that rate. 
-1	Our lunch time over before you can eat
+1	Buffet was excellent. 
+1	I wanted some salad and a couple of pieces of pizza with no leftovers, so this was awesome. 
+1	Nicely priced, too. 
+1	Friendly staff. 
+1	Great food and great options. 
+1	Great place to hold parties for large groups. 
+1	Gluten free crust options. 
+1	Great tasting Pizza, try their super 6. 
+1	Will not be disappointed. 
+1	Their buffalo wings are very tasty also.
-1	Was really disappointed this evening with the way the food was prepared, I sat there and watched it being cooked and it seemed like everyone was having a great time in the kitchen, I trusted the order to be right, I got home and was missing chips and salsa, missing the extra hot sauce, missing the fact I ordered flour tortillas with my chicken tacos and i received corn tortillas, I am glad the staff was having a great ol time talking dancing and singing in the kitchen, they need to pay more attention to what people order rather than sit and have a coffee shop conversation. 
-1	I called the restaurant and it took 45 min for a chips and salsa to arrive, let alone I had to call twice, then they didn't even seem to care to replace the order that was incorrect. 
-1	Get your stuff together, I order from here once a week and they always get it right, because it may be an off night doesn't mean screw around and get the order wrong. 
-1	I am to say VERY disappointed in the way I was treated as a regular customer. 
-1	I will find other places to go unless this place corrects the order accordingly. 
-1	Unacceptable!
+1	The food was good and fresh.
+1	No minimum order to get delivery. 
+1	The delivery was fast.
-1	First off this place is located in wrigleyville aka party town so it's drunk people food which means it's nasty when you're sober I got a suzio chimichanga and rice and beans and an horcahata and it was $20 the rice wasn't Spanish the beans were from the can the meat was nasty and overpriced as hell for nasty food
-1	Web page menu deceiving. 
-1	It shows  carne asada  a plate in a photo but it's not served. 
-1	I had the chicken taco dinner which the meat was dried out. 
+1	Other people in our party had steak burritos which they said were good. 
0	BYOB. 
0	Very average food.
+1	5 of us landed on a gold mine last night 
+1	Everything was delicious. 
0	I ate the shrimp taco dinner with black beans and rice. 
+1	Oh it's so good! 
+1	Everyone was very pleased with their meals.
+1	Amazing meal and atmosphere. 
+1	For our special occasion, we were treated to a special seat in the kitchen. 
+1	We at our food only a few feet away from where it was made. 
+1	The chef and staff made our experience unforgettable.
+1	Always have great meals at Balena! 
+1	Particularly if you go with a large enough group (8-10) -- there's an awesome table in the back. 
+1	It's like you're in a home (with some top notch food!)
+1	Good food and nice place. 
+1	I enjoyed the drinks. 
0	Went her for the gf birthday. 
+1	It was well lit with very good food options. 
+1	I think that's the best part is the menu and the wait staff. 
+1	The orchietta spaghetti and steak were excellent. 
-1	Portions are on the smaller side, so if you like a lot of food I recommend a side
+1	I've dined here twice and loved it! 
+1	A little pricey but the food is worth it. 
+1	The pizza is the best!
+1	My wife and I held our rehearsal dinner at Balena and it was a wonderful experience. 
+1	We heard nothing but positive feedback from our guests about how fantastic the venue, the drinks, and the food were. 
+1	Everyone  loved the homemade pasta and especially the chicken (heard several compliments about how delicious the chicken was as well as the rest of the food). 
+1	Additionally, the waiters and staff were extremely friendly and helpful with assisting our guests with their questions and needs, they went the extra mile to make sure everyone enjoyed themselves.
+1	The Balena team was very easy to communicate with and made it easy to ask questions to get things organized for the rehearsal dinner. 
+1	We truly appreciate the hard work the Balena team put into making our rehearsal dinner happen and making it flawless.
+1	Great secret little spot right in the middle of the mag mile. 
+1	It's warm, cozy, Sumptuous and stylish. 
+1	The food is top quality and the service is very attentive. 
+1	I love their cornbread, do not miss it. 
+1	All their salads are phenomenal as well.
+1	I loved the food and the ambience, it was fantastic.  
+1	The live jazz band was great.  
-1	The one thing that was hard to do was find it.  
0	It is not located facing Michigan Avenue, you enter on the Grand Avenue side of the building.  
+1	The cornbread there is some of the best I ever had, and I know food.  
+1	The appetizers were great, especially the spinach dip.  
+1	It had great servers who took their time and explained everything to our group.  
+1	We are the Unlimbited Potential Amputee Support Group all of our wheelchairs fit in the place at our table.  
+1	Food was served hot and fresh and was good to the last drop.  
+1	Drinks were a bit pricey, but worth it.  
+1	I would recommend this place to visitors easily, including the elderly in wheelchairs.
+1	This place is pretty swank and the burger was excellent. 
+1	Service was good. 
-1	Prices reflect their location (pricey) and everything was just too dark for no reason. 
+1	The band was pretty good though, and that was a neat experience. 
+1	Bring someone here if they're a date that likes nice things; don't come here with a buddy.
0	The first thing caught our attention was the server. 
+1	He was a mid-age super professional and charismatic server I have ever seen in my life.
0	We had burger and the lamb sandwich. 
+1	Both of then are absolutely awesome in terms of taste, quality, and presentation. 
-1	My only suggestion: I expect the lamb to be more flavorful as the nature of the lamb is little bit smelly compared to beef as many people don't like it.
+1	Though there was a bit of a wait to get started (due to a shift change mixup), once it did the experience was lovely.  
+1	The service was then on point and the food was damn tasty. 
+1	I'm a Southerner who does not like sweet cornbread but from what I could tell, those who do will love Bandera's version. 
+1	The house smoked salmon was fantastic as were all the dishes that my party ordered. 
+1	The banana cream pie is well worth it, too. 
+1	Excellent live jazz was an expert touch. 
+1	This place is great for dates, business meetings and/or nights out with your friends if you're 30+. 
+1	This was an awesome, random find in downtown Chicago.
+1	This is my neighborhood spot when I want to watch a game or get a decent happy hour special. 
+1	I come here very often on Wednesdays for the $1.25 beer / half priced martini special. 
+1	And of course they have half priced appetizers every day from 4-7pm.  
+1	There is almost always a place to sit since the space is large, although the top area is blocked off pretty often. 
+1	I usually sit at the bar, and the bartenders do a great job of serving everyone quickly. 
+1	The drinks are always made correctly, but I do think they could have a bigger selection of whiskeys.
+1	The food here is also great. 
0	I usually get the boneless wings, which come out on a cute little cast iron pan. 
+1	The chips and dips appetizer is also good for sharing. 
+1	I will keep coming here as long as they have their great happy hour specials and fun environment for watching sports.
+1	Phenomenal service! 
+1	I hosted an engagement party at this location and they went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. 
+1	The event coordinator, Amanda, was super professional and answered all my questions and was super helpful especially since I was trying to plan this event from out of town. 
+1	We had a large party of 30 plus and we were in the upstairs private loft and our waitress made countless trips up and down the stairs to make sure all of our orders were taken care of. 
+1	10/10 Service. 
+1	Would highly recommend.
+1	I really enjoy Bar Louie! 
+1	Cheap drinks, and really cheap burgers on Tuesdays. 
+1	For being a dollar, also, the burgers are pretty good, though of course, the specialty burgers are much better. 
+1	My boyfriend and I come here whenever we can just for a night out. 
+1	We love the food, and we also love the ambiance of the bar: not too crowded, not too sports bar-ish, just a fun and cozy place for food and drinks.
+1	Cozy atmosphere with interesting locals and tourists having various beers and cocktails. 
+1	Friendly staff and your choice of bar seating or sitting next to the windows.
+1	We originally went here for the outdoor patio and craft beer, but ended up staying inside for lunch and multiple drinks once we saw the great food selection and interior design. 
+1	Good food, good service, and amazing atmosphere.  
+1	Highly recommended.
+1	Great casual sandwich place in Evanston. 
+1	Huge portions and large list of craft beers. 
-1	The bar seating area is quite cramped so those that don't like getting cozy may prefer a table. 
-1	The prices are on the higher end hence 4 star rating. 
-1	33 dollars for a chicken sandwich and 2 beers is a bit much.
+1	Amazing beer selection, generous sized burgers and sandwiches. 
+1	Beer towers. 
+1	Salads. 
+1	Sides. 
+1	Nachos! 
+1	Also serves brunch. 
+1	Bat 17 also has a pool bar next door. 
+1	Definitely an Evanston establishment!
+1	I would have gave this place 5 stars because the food is amazing! 
-1	But we drove all the way here for the food and pool hall and they do not have pool tables like advertised! 
-1	They should change their website and let people know that they no longer have pool tables available
+1	Came hungry, left full.  
+1	Burger was above average, sweet potato fries good, and local IPA beer good as well.  
+1	No shortage of sports on TV.  
0	Both White Sox and Cubs on at the same time.  
+1	Nice!
+1	Pretty decent.  
-1	Not the most amazing. 
-1	They need to quit bragging about a "best of" ranking that is several years old.
+1	Great service. 
+1	Really friendly staff. 
+1	And the food was perfect. 
0	I haven't been on the Southside in awhile. 
+1	And I was so glad I stopped there to eat. 
+1	It was great. 
+1	Thanks you guys, you made my night.
+1	Excellent service from the bartender that took care of a full bar and tables. 
+1	He did an amazing job! 
+1	Food is hot, delicious and timely.
+1	My server Kate, short hair, was the best server I've ever had! 
+1	She was so polite and took care of our table so well! 
+1	The manager of the night, Aham is also fantastic!
+1	Waitress was nice food was delivered on time places nice and welcoming
-1	Great food but lazy staff 
-1	I get my order messed up all the time and have to argue for compensation like it's the least you can do charging those prices, ruining a customers meal experience is unacceptable with no compensation not that is even with compensation but atleast then the company would be decent
-1	First off, the service here is bad. 
-1	It took forever for them to make an omelette. 
-1	The waitress kept coming back to the table to make sure she had the order correct. 
-1	It was very quiet and the two waitresses were running around clueless. 
-1	It may be hard to believe, but it actually seemed like the waitresses were helping cook in the kitchen. 
-1	They would disappear into the back and come out frantic serving food. 
-1	The icing on the cake was when our waitress messed up our bill and acted as if she was doing us a favor by not charging us the coffee, but it is included in the breakfast. 
-1	The food here is incredibly bland and on the verge of tasting just plain bad. 
-1	How do you get an omelette wrong? 
-1	We are talking eggs here. 
-1	Avoid this place at all costs.
+1	Cute little restaurant that has some very tasty food but even better service. 
+1	Francisco, the manager went above and beyond to make sure our first time there was memorable. 
+1	Also, the owner, bartender and even one of the cooks stopped by our table on the patio and checked in on us! 
+1	We felt at home and will definitely be back. 
+1	Great view and reasonable prices!!!
+1	This is a "gem" of a spot hidden beside trump tower in Chicago. 
+1	Great staff and met the owner.  
+1	It's a family business so  cool it's not a chain.  
+1	Best pizza I ever had!!
-1	We were looking forward to a great meal due to overall great reviews, however, had quite a poor experience. 
-1	The restaurant was not very busy, but it took us a while to be served by our waiter, and he was fairly rude throughout our service. 
-1	We ordered the mushroom rigatoni and it was so acidic it tasted like stomach acid or vomit- no exaggeration. 
-1	Also, we ordered the lasagna of the day, which we were told was 4 meat, and there was absolutely no meat and just mushrooms. 
-1	We attempted to tell our server, but he didn't give us the time of day. 
-1	We ended up each taking a few bites of our food, paying, and leaving. 
-1	Maybe they were just having an off day, but we will certainly not be returning. 
+1	Pros: great location downtown.
+1	The tacked-on �Italian Bistro & Pizzeria� is the first clue that this location of Bacino�s goes well beyond the �heart healthy� thin and stuffed pies that put this Chicago chain on the map. 
+1	The decent breakfast selection includes waffles and omelettes, but we�d recommend going in the afternoon or evening for one of the nine pasta plates and, yes, the pizza. 
0	The cook recommends the double cheese burger. 
+1	Once you've got burger in hand add condiments, pickles are there, along with the standard offerings one would put on a burger. 
+1	They also have hot dogs, Italian beef, and some other selections. 
+1	There's a fully stocked bar. 
+1	United Center, formerly Chicago Stadium, is a couple of blocks away. 
+1	Very friendly staff. 
-1	Place is a little odd. 
-1	Some areas feel like it's a partial storage area. 
0	Getting food to go might be best. 
0	If you're looking for a good burger.. 
-1	Do not go here! 
-1	Pickles are thicker than my burger patty and its tasteless. 
-1	The bun was massive and dry. 
-1	We ate in and they have a stuffed dead Goat in corner that is falling apart. 
-1	Very unappetizing. 
-1	Beware.  
+1	Decent place to watch a game. 
-1	Layout is odd, not a ton of seating and it's extremely busy before and after Hawks game. 
0	Did not have food. 
-1	$6 for a double cheese burger is too much when you make me put my own toppings on it. 
+1	I got to choose between onions and pickles. 
-1	That's it. 
-1	All I tasted was bread. 
-1	The meat is small and thin.
0	I just returned from eating at this place. 
-1	While seated there, I kept on checking the name and reading the reviews because I was certain I got confused and I had gone to the wrong place. 
-1	To make it quick: worst burger ever! 
-1	I ordered a regular cheeseburger, the patty was so think I thought they were kidding. 
-1	The bread was ok, but I didnt mean to eat a bun for dinner. 
-1	No lettuce, no tomato, no mayo. 
-1	Nothing. 
-1	Just a dry, thin patty inside a toasted bun. 
-1	You gotta be kidding me! 
-1	How could anyone thing their burgers are good is beyond me.
0	Iconic dive bar, which has since spawned a local chain. 
+1	I highly recommend hitting up this original location if you're in town or looking for something touristy to do. 
+1	Also, if you love retro places this is a spot for you. 
+1	Walking in you're immediately transported back to the 70s and earlier. 
+1	Made nationally famous by SNL's cheezeborger skit. 
-1	Beer prices are a little higher then normal. 
+1	Staff was very nice. 
+1	You could probably look at the memorabilia all day. 
0	Don't forget this place is below street level so you've got to go down to the tunnel streets to find it. 
+1	Don't let that intimidate you though.
0	I went here because of John Belushi. 
-1	It was a fun atmosphere, but they move you along, so don't expect to be staring at a menu too long. 
+1	And the guy that was pestering me to get a double cheeseburger was right - a single wasn't enough. 
0	Don't make the same mistake I did.
+1	Nothing like walking down into a parking garage and finding an old bar.  
+1	The burgers were great and the service didn't disappoint. 
0	Sat at the bar and had a beer.  
+1	Bartender was chatty as well as the other patrons.
+1	It is the thing you think it is: Decent value dive bar doing a running reenactment of that SNL skit. 
+1	A lot less pricey than other tourist-targeting spots, though. 
+1	Bring out of town visitors in for a beer. 
+1	I’ve been coming to BIN 36 for the last eight months roughly once a month. 
+1	Service is great, the manager or owner (not exactly sure) is always there making sure everything is running smoothly. 
+1	Today, at lunch the manager/owner noticed that my table was a little wobbly and took it upon himself to fix it without me bringing it up. 
+1	A+ service in my book, exemplary  service. 
+1	The atmosphere is pleasant and light. 
+1	The brunch options were unique and well  prepared. 
+1	Its worth a try. 
+1	Don't miss lunch or dinner at this lovely restaurant.

+1	The burger was great, the salads are good, and the fish sandwich was terrific. 
+1	We were there for lunch, but with the excellent wine selection, dinner would be fabulous as well! 
+1	The owner, Enoch, is there a lot and makes sure that everything goes well. 
+1	I'll be back! 
-1	Great food, smallish portions and the food took a long time to come out.  
+1	They gave us free drinks to accommodate the wait.  
0	Hopefully it was just a glitch
+1	Organized a private event at Bin36 and truly had a phenomenal experience. 
+1	The service was excellent, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and we truly has a phenomenal time.

+1	Comfortable atmosphere makes it welcoming for families as well.Great coffee and food!  
+1	Staff is friendly.  
-1	Expect to possibly encounter a wait. 
0	Not fast food, a place to sit and enjoy your food outside of the rat race
+1	Big fan. 
+1	On a soup bender and they keep a great rotation of homemade soups daily to keep it "fresh" for me.
+1	Coffee is great and reasonably priced! 
-1	Staff could be a bit more friendly. 
-1	Maybe not much experience in the restaurant business.
+1	One of the best cafes in Valpo. 
+1	They have good food and an incredible loose lead tea collection. 
+1	Being a tea enthusiast I love this place! 
+1	Very chill atmosphere too.  
+1	We love the Bongo Room up north. 
+1	This one has the same great food. 
-1	But for me, the downside is just how tiny and cramped the space is. 
-1	It gets really packed here and the space is just incredibly tight with little elbow room.
+1	Other than that, I can't fault the food. 
+1	It's really good. 
+1	So if you don't mind small spaces or don't have a large party, it's a solid choice. 
+1	The food at this bongo room is great!! 
+1	Coffee and tea selections are really good. 
-1	They would do well if they sold coffee to go. 
-1	I just hate they don’t have alcohol. 
+1	Eggs benedict were fantastic. 
+1	The house potatoes were over seasoned though. 
-1	Also  they charged 3.5 for tea/coffee without showing the price anywhere
+1	Very cute place, small menu but very delicious items and large items.  
+1	Really great place. 
-1	This is a breakfast/brunch place so fair warning. 
+1	Loved it though. 
+1	I got the lemon brioche French toast so yummy
+1	Delicious! 
+1	Portions were big especially for the price! 
+1	Price range was about $8-15 but well worth it. 
+1	I had the tomatillo egg white scramble. 
+1	It has a generous amount of avocado which impressed me. 
+1	Staff was friendly. 
+1	Probably not the best place for a large group because it's a small restaurant but our party of 4 was fine. 
+1	I would definitely go again. 
-1	Kitchen closes early on Sundays. 
-1	No dark beers. 
+1	The staff was friendly and the locals were more than happy to chat with us while we were there.
+1	Alot of good food for the price! 
+1	We will be back next trip up that way! 
+1	Nice sized beef patties not some thin strip of meat! 
+1	Food and service was very goodAnother great time. ..  
+1	I love it. 
+1	Reminds me of the good old fashioned bars that use to be around.  
+1	Dawn the bar tend and the staff, people in the bar very friendly happy go lucky people. ?

+1	A lot of us bike riders stopped here because it is a great friendly place . 
+1	Music on the weekends, good food, good people. 
0	I ordered the Loco Burger and kimchi fries. 
+1	Overall, I liked the food and the place had a good atmosphere for a quick bite. 
-1	However, I found the food quite salty and had to drink a lot of water to get through it all. 
-1	Additionally, Restaurant cleanliness could be improved, I noticed quite a food crumbs on our table and around the floor.
+1	I love their burgers! 
+1	Great tasting burger not over seasoned. 
+1	I recommend place!
+1	Tried an unique and delicious BNG burger with bacon, onion, and egg.

+1	Service was quick and although I ordered carry out, the ambience inside seemed really nice.
+1	Their bNg is a great tasting burger! 
+1	All the ingredients make it great. 
+1	Even the fries are good. 
+1	Not overly salted and/or seasoned. 
+1	Even the location is great. 
+1	Close to the beach so you can go for a walk on the beach after you're done eating. 
+1	And let all that food digest with a calm listening of the waves afterwards. 
+1	We certainly did. 
+1	I'd for sure recommend. 
+1	Amazing fusion Korean restaurant near Loyola. 
+1	I love this place. 
+1	The atmosphere is very casual.

-1	Order was wrong, fries were overcooked.  
-1	Better off eating beforehand. 
+1	Bottom Lounge was the venue for our recent wedding (September 2017) and it was perfect for our 80 guests. 
+1	We had the ceremony and reception on site, utilizing both the indoor and outdoor space on the second floor. 
+1	Natalie is their wedding coordinator and is absolutely wonderful to work with. 
+1	She's very efficient, knows what she's doing, and makes sure that everything looks amazing on the big day. 
+1	She has an inventory of items, such as dessert platters and cut wood discs for display that she's happy to let couples utilize. 
+1	The space already has nice lighting, a Chicago feel, a permanent bar, and a DJ booth, so it saves the time of trying to plan the room from a completely "blank canvas." 
+1	The optional photo booth and pinball machines are a fun touch. 
+1	The food was delicious and was served family style. 
+1	It was an overall great planning experience and perfect wedding day. 
+1	Thank you to Natalie and everyone at Bottom Lounge!!
+1	This is a great small venue where you can be close to the performers from anywhere in the room. 
+1	Though it can be a bit cramped in the hallway where merch is usually sold, you can see the stage from most of the tables. 
+1	The staff is helpful and they have a great food & alcohol selection. 
+1	They were even very accommodating to my gluten allergy, which is not always the case at concert venues. 
+1	Even though it's a small place, it's one of my favourites. 
+1	And as an added bonus, the bathrooms are reasonably clean for a concert venue!
+1	Fantastic venue for sound, anywhere you stand has a great view so you can still see the performer if you want to stay out of the madness in the front. 
+1	Most importantly the drinks are very reasonable priced and bartenders give a good pour. 
+1	Make sure to tip well. 
+1	They deserve it.
+1	Truly friendly and accommodating staff. 
+1	The beer selection is second to none. 
-1	My only gripe is pricing, but it seems within reason for this town, so yeah.
0	Was there for an event for TechWeek. 
+1	We were upstairs in that space which was nice. 
-1	It was small for the group that was there. 
+1	The service was excellent all the bartender were attentive to however stepped up to the bar even with all the people that were there. 
+1	That is one reason I would come back. 
0	Also since I didn't have a change to have any food there. 
0	I have to see what it's like.
+1	The Mexican restaurant Fiesta Brava is very good you must give it a try!
+1	Good place to get fuel
+1	Brick Stone is one of those micro-breweries / restaurants that really has done that mix well.  
+1	The atmosphere is warm with a touch of elegance.  
+1	The staff is friendly and the food is top-notch!   
+1	The price is a bit on the high side, but you get your money's worth.  
+1	The in-house beers are good and they always have deals going on.  
+1	Another side note: they focus on American style burgers, steak, and chicken, but they do some other types of cuisine very well.  
+1	The pork flautas my wife and I had were delicious and just enough for two!
+1	They also have larger tables available for larger parties.  
+1	With all those things, it's little wonder why they have been around for years!
+1	Wonderful place to go with friends or family. 
+1	Very good food and drink Selection. 
+1	will be back soon.
+1	Always a great meal;  Love the beer sampler; Jambalaya was huge, tasty and just the right spice; Shrimp & Grits was good as well.

+1	Highly recommended!
+1	Brick Stone is great. 
+1	They have a wonderful burger that is put between two Grilled Cheese. 
+1	Everything I have had on the menu has been fantastic.
+1	The service was great! 
+1	Get the single glass of white sangria vs the carafe, its stronger and prettier. 
+1	I also wish they would've warned us off just how large the rigatoni is because it couldve fed 8 people and there were only a couple of us.  
+1	The food was pretty good. 
+1	The mozzarella garlic bread was amazing though!!
-1	I ordered using a delivery service so I can't speak for the service or atmosphere, however my order had no eating utensils or seasonings. 
-1	I ordered spaghetti & meatballs w/ bread, but everything was pretty bland & tasteless. 
-1	Very disappointing for $20, or any price for that matter, so I don't recommend.
+1	this is my favorite buca! 
+1	there's always something fun to look at, and  the food is great. 
+1	For lunch there's an option other than family style,  which is good!
0	We made reservations for our son's graduation party with the family. 
0	We needed a place with a variety of food items and space to contain our chaos. 
+1	We found both. 
+1	The food, from the salad to the chocolate cake, was amazing. 
+1	They packed up our leftovers for us and we celebrated again the next day.

+1	This is the second time we have met here for a celebration and both times have been great experiences.
+1	One of our favorites. 
+1	Great food, hard working employees that seem to really care. 
+1	Some of the very best food you can get, home style Italian is where it's at. 
+1	The best ambiance you can have at a chain restaurant  
0	Chicago is rich in culture. 
+1	That is exemplified by one of it's premier  gems, a blues club known as Buddy Guy's Legend. 
+1	When I stepped through the doors an electrifying  ambience embraced me. 
+1	Guest from near and far enjoying the house delights literally were treated with a Monday Open Mike that included a Buddy Guy moment backed by the Jimmy Burns Group (house band of the evening). 
+1	The night featured  riveting appearances by Mr G. Guy (Buddy's son), Mr Wes, Ms Holley Maxwell, and Ms Queen. 
0	The evening was rounded out with a rotation of sign in jam musicians who were not short on talent themselves ... 
0	Also, a shout out to my new friends from St. Louis, glad you had fun .... 
0	Nice spot Buddy
+1	Had an amazing time. 
+1	Prices were reasonable. 
+1	Service was great. 
+1	Louisiana Al was fabulous. 
+1	Highly recommend Legend's. 
+1	The Mike Dangerous Band was incredible. 
0	They played 2 hours nonstop. 
+1	Buddy Guy sat in with the band to make it that much better. 
+1	It was a wonderful experience. 
+1	Rated 5 stars for the overall experience.  
+1	Food is a solid 4 - wonderful homestyle Cajun/Creole. 
+1	I was delighted to find that the new location, while a little bit bigger and cleaner, retains a bit of the "dive bar" feel and has a similar intimate layout like the original location.  
0	It's all about the music here. 
+1	Pure and true blues at it's finest. 
+1	Every table close to the stage. 
+1	Even if you don't like or know the blues when you go in, you will love it by the time you leave. 
+1	Great music...great atmosphere....great food. 
+1	I come here for pick up 1-2 a week and always have to good experience even if it's slammed packed busy. 
+1	The general manager, Phil is always helping his staff and treats each customer very well. 
+1	Coming from a server background it's so nice to see a GM get his hands dirty and help!!!
-1	The server told me that something was too new, shouldn't have been on the menu, and cannot be made because there's no button for it. 
0	After I explained that there are 2 ingredients and if you have those, a monkey could make it...she then said "well I'll go ask if they can". 
0	Why didn't she do that to begin with? 
0	"There's no button for it" is a terrible reason not to at least ask if something can be made that is on the menu.
+1	Luke was amazing... he helped my daughter when she got the wrong (to spicy) wings...amd it was great.. very up beat and a joy to be around..kist all around fun...Food was okay nothing special. 
-1	I was expecting more flavor from the screaming nacho burger. 
-1	All you could really taste was onion and an unflavored meat patty. 
+1	I have to give them the service was quick.
+1	Have had great service every time I've eaten here, which has been for lunch during the week. 
+1	The fried pickles are amazing, as are the boneless wings in Wild sauce.
+1	Love this local fondue restaurant!  
+1	The owner was so wonderful- really made it a great experience.  
+1	Our server Parker was attentive and friendly.   
+1	Portions were a bit small, but we still left feeling full.  
+1	Desert was delicious- we scraped the pot clean!
+1	I did my daughter's Sweet 16 party here and the children loved it!! 
+1	The staff were AWESOME and the food too! 
+1	I would most definetly come again and again.
+1	It does cost a pretty penny, but you also get a lot for the money. 
+1	It's a fun time and the food is delicious, great to go with a small group of friends. 
-1	Me and my boyfriend went to try Caf� Fondue for my birthday and it wasn't a good experience for us at all. 
0	When we went inside there was about 2 tables with people and it was fairly empty for a Friday night. 
-1	The waiter was very kind but the food was awful. 
-1	They brought out salad for us and it was clearly store bought bagged salad that was clearly old because the edges of the lettuce were brown. 
-1	The meat they brought out was not clean. 
-1	They served my chicken and it was coated with flower instead of being clean and fresh. 
-1	Seemed as if they coated the chicken with flower and put it away. 
0 	The desert was maybe the best thing they served. 
0	I expected a nice experience, to be able to go to a fondue spot that was closer but I could I have went to Gejas in Chicago instead and spent the extra money for the better quality. 
-1	Caf� fondue was cheaper but it was a rip off.  
-1	It was not worth the money or time.
+1	Amazing!!! 
+1	Love the food and awesome customer service.
+1	The best chicken around!  
0	The owner tells me the chicken is all delivered fresh in the morning and never frozen.  
+1	The skin melts in your mouth and you cannot beat the prices.  
+1	Way better than the chains and the hyped boutique fried chicken places in the City.
-1	I'm giving them ONE star because the workers tried to play me for a foul. 
0	Noticed that there were fries sitting in the basket that appeared to be old, pointed over to the basket, told them I didnt want those fries, and asked for fresh fries. 
0	Saw them drop fresh fries BUT then noticed the OLD fries from the other basket were gone. 
0	Get my food and here I got some light fresh looking fries and some that looked like they were cooked longer which is impossible UNLESS you put the OLD fries back in so they appear to be fresh too. 
0	REALLY! 
0	After I specifically said i didn't want the old fries you give them to me anyway thinking I wouldn't notice. 
0	Had my business up to this point.
-1	If you are looking for a great dine-in experience....this is not the place. 
0	If you are looking for something greasy after a night at the bar, LOOK NO FURTHER! 
+1	Their Chitterlings, fried fish, fried chicken, gyros, Italian beef, and philly are all excellent. 
+1	I love the mild sauce! 
+1	Even better -- you can place your order and walk to the liquor store next door. 
+1	;P For this neighborhood, they are the best option and are open late!
-1	Y'all just suck.. 
-1	Why can't you ever get a simple Italian beef right? 
-1	And god forbid you call and ask for it to be fixed it ain't happening... 
-1	Plus it takes 40 mins at least for the damn food even when u call ahead y'all ain't that damn busy.. 
-1	Ugh
+1	The chicken here is always fresh and very well seasoned. 
+1	Recommend it to anyone looking for some good quality chicken love and miss this place.

0	7:30. 
-1	Still waiting. 
0	8:30. 
-1	Still waiting. 
+1	Offered a round of free drinks. 
-1	9:00 finally seated - at two tables instead of the one large table we reserved. 
-1	Took forever for the food to arrive and we were not even offered menus.  
0	The food was great, but not worth waiting over three hours for.  
-1	We watched several groups of 2, 6 and 8 get seated while we waited and waited. 
+1	Entertainment was fantastic.
0	We were visiting friends in the area and we wanted to get some lunch before we left town to go home. 
+1	We travel a lot and we really like eating at "local" places that have some character,  and this place has it in spades! 
+1	As my wife and I both have lived in Germany, our hosts suggested Chef Klaus's and we were very glad they did. 
0	My wife had her standard Jaeger Schnitzel and I had a German beef sandwich. 
+1	They were both very good, and we would love to go back the next time we are in town.
+1	Authentic German and great live music. 
+1	My whole family loves this place (even the kids). 
+1	If the Nazi�s won the war, this would be every restaurant in America... you'll see what I
mean when you get there. :)
0	No offense to the readers, as a former chef I very rarely give 4 stars and know very few restaurants that deserve 5. 
+1	Though, this is a very good restaurant. 
0	I have only been here twice, but nothing was disappointing about the meal. 
0	For whatever reason we started with the raw oysters. 
+1	4 of the 6 were fresh and good blue point oysters. 
0	2 of them were on their way to turning. 
0	Still, that's our fault, who the hell orders oysters at a German restaurant? 
+1	Aside from that the schnitzel and Goulash dishes we got were very good. 
+1	We sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice and humorous. 
+1	Prices are a little high for the eats, but all in all, you can enjoy a nice atmosphere, nice beers and good food!
-1	Horrible service. 
-1	Waited 25 min for waitress to take our order. 
-1	Never got our salad, never got drink refills, sides were cold. 
-1	Had to ask twice for bread. 
-1	Hardly ever saw our waitress. 
-1	Been eating at the Bier Stube for the past 25 yrs including the one in Frankfort and in Peotone never had service this bad. 
-1	Check was $130.00 and I'm not sure I'll go back. 
-1	So disappointed.
-1	I was very skeptical about how the food was going to taste. 
0	Mind. 
0	Blown. 
+1	So so good!! 
+1	The staff was awesome! 
+1	Loved the decor! 
+1	Wish there was a place like this on the south side,  will definitely return!
+1	My wife and I had lunch today at the Chicago Diner and it was fabulous.  
0	I had the hash with biscuits and gravy, and she had the country fried veggie steak.  
+1	It was delicious.  
+1	Our server was knowledgeable, efficient and delightful.  
+1	The diner reminded me of a small town cafe, but with great visuals on the walls.  
+1	We'll come back next time we are in town!
0	My partner and I were visiting the city and just happened to walk in about 9:45pm. 
+1	We had no idea we were so close to closing time, the staff were so welcoming. 
0	We also had no idea we had walked into a vegetarian restaurant, so that was a pleasant surprise as well! 
+1	The food was maybe the best vegetarian food either of us ever had. 
+1	Our server was hilarious, too. 
+1	Highly recommended!
0	Finally visited this diner with an old friend who was in town. 
-1	The restaurant is so crowded that you feel like your neighbors are at your table, and it's loud. 
0	The food was good, but not allergy friendly. 
+1	My friend had one of the lunch specials and was very impressed, saying that despite being vegan the sandwich was really awesome. 
0	I had a veggie omelette that was good, but apparently contaminated with gluten.
+1	I knew going in it was suppose to be some crazy good food, they did not dissapoint. 
0	Good to know meat free doesn't just mean salad! 
+1	Get dessert...no seriously get it! 
+1	Absolutely delicious food!  
+1	Oh my gosh, we will definitely go back there to eat again.  
0	Appetizers, lobster bisque, seafood, steaks, were all ordered at our table.  
+1	Everyone was very satisfied.  
+1	Love the ambiance, our waiter Phillip was outstanding!  
0	His passion clearly showed as he explained each of the menu items.  
+1	You must go!!! 
+1	This place is very impressive. 
+1	The decor and atmosphere is wonderful. 
+1	The food is tasty and well done especially the steak and oysters. 
+1 	Chicago Firehouse, having reopened after a devastating fire in 2014 is an awesome place for both lunch and dinner. 
+1 	It has a very open feeling with the tall ceilings and great decor, and the food is fantastic. 
+1	Their steaks, burgers and Amish brick chicken are all must trys. 
+1	They have a variety of meeting and banquet rooms upstairs along with a veranda. 
0	This place has a very different atmosphere comparing to other restaurant in South Loop. 
0	The food are good but I didn't think it was outstanding. 
+1	I was impressed with their own Firehouse red wine blend though. 
0	It's a nice change of the restaurant type in the area.  
+1	The food and staff are amazing. 
+1	The ambiance inside is relaxing and elegant. 
+1	It is a great place for a casual date or a special celebration.
-1	My cousin recently had a wedding here, there was almost nothing good about the place except the decorations and the manager. 
-1	The food was awful. 
-1	The wedding cake was cut and served when it was not suppose to be. 
-1	The bartenders were not friendly at all and service overall was very mediocre. 
-1	Worst of all, many decorations and valuables for the wedding were seemingly stolen by the employees and days later have still not been found. 
-1	I would not recommend this place for anybody, especially if you are going for something special like a wedding.
0	I work for Comcast and we have had a few employee meetings there. 
+1	We love there banquet hall.
+1	Great for banquets. 
+1	And their live music night are good too. 
0	Just get to an event early so you don't have to park in their overflow lot.
0	I have been here twice for a funeral luncheon and a baby shower. 
+1	Both times the room was great, service was good and the venue itself is such a nice open place to hold events. 
+1	The rooms all break down to the perfect size for your event including a great outside area.
+1	Great staff. 
+1	Very friendly and accommodating.
0	A friend who lives in Chicago took us there after discovering that my daughter loves chicken and waffles. 
+1	At 10a, I am eating some of the best mac and cheese, collard greens and fried chicken that I have had in a long time. 
+1	I'm from the south, and I can't find a restaurant with food this good at home. 
+1	This is the caliber of food that your parents and grandparents cooked. 
+1	Service was good. 
+1	Even had real sweet tea! 
+1	No complaints. 
+1	If I lived there, I would be a regular, for sure!
0	My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast recently.  
0	We ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of grits.

+1	The chocolate desert was great too!! 
+1	Just don't be scared it's in basement and bit crowded, but worth it!!!!

+1	Everything makes sense.  
+1	Nice ambiance and good music.  
+1	Friendly staff.
+1	We were so hungry, we ate all the foods before remembering to take pictures.
+1	One of our favorite restaurants in Chicago.

+1	Menu changes regularly and food is always fresh and inventive. 
0	BYOB and mostly gluten free.

0	Thank you.
-1	This Chipotle used to be great. 
-1	But now it's filthy and the staff is pretty rude. 
-1	We've had to wipe off a table to sit and eat the last 3 times we have visited. 
-1	The food was good, but they don't keep the line clean so as they push your bowl across the line, it will collect plenty of smushed toppings. 
-1	I think one of the cashiers is racist. 
0	He will only greet/talk to African American people that come through the line. 
-1	If you are white he will not respond to "hello" "how are you" "thank you" or "have a nice day" or even make eye contact with you. 
-1	Just a very unpleasant and odd Chipotle. 
-1	If you know of another, I would say it is worth the extra mileage.
0	Went there at 8:30 on a Tuesday and a line out the door the whole time we were there. 
+1	The staff was quick to get orders out. 
+1	Orders were correct and portions were fine. 
0	They seem short staffed but it was probably unexpected for a Tuesday. 
-1	A few things lacking napkin holders empty and there was a wait on chips. 
-1	Ours were stale probably from a lull before the rush but wasn't willing to sit around just for some chips.C
+1	onsistly good. 
+1	I order with the app and it is always ready. 
+1	Portions are good and people treat you well. 
+1	Definitely will continue to visit!

+1	Try the Steak Mexicans. 
0	Yummy?
+1	Always a pleasure at this Chipotle. 
+1	Food always in large portions, and very tasty. 
+1	Restaurant clean. 
+1	Staff friendly. 
+1	Even though line long, it moves at a steady pace. 
+1	I will definitely be back.
+1	Food was great! 
0	Much to my surprise. 
+1	I didn't know what to expect from looking at the place from the outside but inside was pretty nice and the food and service made it even better.
+1	What can I say, I love the service the food and the atmosphere... 
+1	You feel so at home when you enter, the owner greets everyone with a smile and a hand shake... 
+1	Great place all around !!!!!!!!
+1	We had dinner there last night, specials were superb.  
+1	All the food items were perfectly prepared without being preciously presented.  
+1	The chefs are amazing.  
+1	The waitstaff, including our server Roxy, also completely charming, professional, attentive without hovering and never pushy, qualities that I as a former waiter from college days can totally appreciate.  
0	And this was reflected in our tip.
+1	Tuna amazing! 
-1	Salmon not so much. 
+1	Service and atmosphere great!
0	Ok food service was great, small portions. 
-1	$7 for a salad with your meal I thought was a bit pricey.
-1	This club is becoming the worst Club in Chicago!!! 
0	And trust me I've been there from the beginning, when they're was pool tables and the girls were friendly, polite and Hot!!! 
0	And Nick didn't have a limp!!! 
0	And Chris, Tom and Dino used to shake my hand and thank me for coming in, And champagne room were reasonable priced, and the pictures of the girls on the walls actually work there, some of those girls haven't worked there in over 10 years!!!!
0	Plus when you actually went there on a Wednesday night and it was jam-packed!!!! 
-1	Now the place is dead, the girls are rude, ignorant and 25 pounds overweight!!!!  
-1	Me and my buddy we're there for over 2 hours and none of the girls came up to us at all!!! 
-1	But there was 3-4 girls sitting next to us stuffing their face and bitching and moaning about how money they weren't making!!!! 
-1	So after about 45 minutes of listening to this we decided to leave and go to polekatz where the girls they're treated us like royalty and we ended up getting great back rubs and lots of dances and talk to some wonderful girls. 
-1	That's the way it used to be here!!!!!
-1	This club gets worse every year! 
and I think it's because of management, all they care about is whoring the girls out and  selling champagne rooms!!!!! 
0	Plus They need to give some props to the wait staff instead of beating them up all the time threatening the fire them. 
0	If it wasn't for them this place would already be close just like Allure Gentlemen's Club which they owned!
-1	Here is my advice stop remodeling the place because every time you do you make it worse!!!! 
-1	Nobody likes this new design feels like we're sitting on school bus you, might as well put seat belts in the chairs if that's the look you were going for!!!! 
0	And remodeled the management, security and the girls!!!! 
0	Customers could care less how the place looks, we care about the entertainment and the service we receive not how the establishment looks!!!! 
0	If that was the case Jimmy's would have been closed 20 years ago!!!
+1	Wow this place is awesome, Gracie and Asia are the most friendliest, best dancers around. 
+1	My husband and I went with a group of friends and we all love this place. 
+1	My husband and I recommend Gracie, she's awesome and very friendly. 
+1	HIGHLY RECOMMEND HER FOR SURE AND ASIA. 
+1	THEY'RE THE BEST!!!!!!!!?????????????????????
0	Went with a group of seven ordered two bottles and as I was playing the slot machines a stripper walks up to me and I told her watch my machine and I'll give you $20 as I go to the washroom she clears my machine of 175+ dollars and walks off... when I bring it to management they get mad at me and kick me and my group out before the second bottle was even touched and as I have made several attempts to resolve this issue there has been no response back from management nor the owner Dino.... 
-1	Been going with friends for years but after this this I will no longer....  
0	The worst part is I now have a group of 10 people ready to leave 10 more reviews!!!!
+1	Nora is definitely one of the cutest girls there. 
+1	She's your girl next door type and is extremely talkative and will certainly make your heart race!
-1	Girls suck, "security/bouncers" assholes, overall experience was terrible. 
0	The girls extend dances with out telling you. 
0	Ended up paying for 2 dances when I only wanted one. 
-1	Shady place, stay away from here and spend your money elsewhere. 
0	P.s. 
-1	Girls here look like my big toe.
0	Went for the Halloween event. 
0	Paid 12 bucks at the door and felt like we were part of an intimate 90s rock concert.

+1	Best time at Halloween in a long time.
+1	I eat lunch here fairly often, had everything on the menu at least once.

+1	Great patio, and delicious beers. 
0	Just go.
0	We we're in town for the Frozen 4 and stopped by because of the closeness to the train stop. 
0	Really wasn't expecting much but boy were we surprised. 
+1	The beer was outstanding and even better was the food. 
+1	Our waitress Joey was great, her recommendations for food were spot on! 
+1	The pork sliders, apple fritter hush puppies, and green beans were some of the best dishes I have ever had. 
+1	Highly recommend this place! 
+1	Keep up the good work.
+1	I always love coming here. 
+1	Staff is cool. 
+1	And the drinks, food are not priced bad at all. 
0	And the live music is always phenomenal. ?
+1	Great outdoor seating area, friendly service and good food. 
0	I had the cobra club sandwich with tots. 
+1	Three types of bbq sauce on the table along with ketchup made for great flavors on the tots! 
0	No drinking this visit, but they have a plethora of beers to choose from. 
+1	Will definitely be back.
+1	Love the go-carts. 
-1	Golf coarse needs new carpeting.
+1	I walked in and was greeted immediately with a big smile by Wendy. 
0	She signed me up for the rewards program while I was there as well. 
+1	It was one of her first days on the job and she was so patient with me. 
+1	I wasn't able to get the other co workers name that helped us out that day, but you guys are always sooo nice. 
+1	Thank you for making my experience seem less stressful. 
-1	I don't usually carry credit cards with me, so we were having issues processing my rewards. 
+1	But we go it to go through and I'm happy that I will be able to enjoy my free bottle of wine each month! 
+1	Thanks Wendy!
+1	Always fantastic food and service. 
+1	Michelle was so sweet and attentive. 
+1	Hostesses are all friendly when you walk in, great atmosphere!
+1	The best bread, service, food, and soda/tea!!!!!
+1	Come here for any special occasion or just because, this is the best food ever they are so friendly here and if you have kids they give you a free chocolate covered strawberry the burgers are the bomb and the pretzel bread is the best bread I've ever had!!!!! 
+1	Come here I promise you won't regret it.
+1	A great wine selection and honestly the food is really good. 
+1	It's a chain atmosphere, but still enjoyable. 
-1	My only suggestion would be to be less pushy on selling the wine. 
0	However I do understand that is the job of the restaurant. 
+1	Good selection of food and reasonably priced, good value wines. 
+1	Not exceptional, but good value. 
+1	Especially for a resteraunt.
0	You should visit Illinois center location. 
+1	People working there treat you real well. 
+1	I buy lunch a couple of times every week and I am very happy with each and everyone working there.
0	Thank you
+1	Only came here because I had a free entree coupon but I was pleasantly surprised by the superb taste of the rustic food. 
+1	Love the bread they use and I would definitely recommend it for a quick lunch or dinner stop. 
+1	Try the pesto chicken! 
+1	It's delicious! 
+1	Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. 
+1	Everything was very tasty and seemed fresh. 
0	It gets busy on weekdays during lunch, but the line moves quickly.
0	I've been to this Cosi a few times now, both during lunch rushes and without and once for breakfast. 
-1	Each time I've felt that the lines were a bit disorganized and the staff was a little behind, even the one time that they weren't all that busy. 
-1	Everyone was friendly but it felt rushed and not the level of service I've had at other Cosi's. 
+1	That being said, if you've eaten the food here it is the same as the other locations, good cafe food. 
+1	I think with some of the other options in the immediate area that it isn't my top choice for sandwiches but the soups have always tasted pretty decent.
+1	The service here is very quick and the food is pretty good. 
+1	So many healthy options to choosr from (salads, samdwiches, soup). 
+1	Popular spot at my work
+1	Prompt service.
0	On Sept 3rd I came in to eat your buffet. 
0	I remembered. 
0	there  was a format for customers that said when they were finished eating to turn over their paid receipt. 
0	Well I had a plate of salad that I finished and headed back to get more food. 
0	When I got back I found my glass of water and a clear table. 
0	I said "What the"? 
0	and the server told me where the table I was sitting at. 
0	She apologized and brought me another glass of water. 
0	Later she told me that some of the staff doesn't comply with that policy of a turned over receipt. 
0	Do customers have to inform the server that they are finished and not returning from now on? 
0	Or is this something the server has to make the call on? 
0	I'm just glad I didn't have to get up and didn't leave a plate full of food! 
0	Also I'm glad that the section I was in wasn't crowded or I would be out of a table also. 
0	I just want to know what to expect if I ever come back to eat there again! 
0	It would be interesting to know!
+1	Because it is a good buffet and I been eating there for years. 
+1	Surprisingly awesome breakfast! 
0	I haven't been here in a while.

+1	Food was good and a decent variety. 
0	Busy place. 
0	Being this busy, it's hard for staff to keep up... 
-1	Both drink stations were out of ice and ladies room wasn't clean (according to my wife). 
+1	But overall, was good. 
+1	Better than we expected for a buffet. 
+1	Lots of families here. 
0	If you're looking for intimate dining, this is not it. 
+1	But if you're wanting to feed a lot of people a lot of decently good food quickly, we'd recommend it. 
+1	The food isn't wow-great, but everything we had was pretty good.
+1	I love this place and they have the best food. 
+1	Super clean everywhere in here. 
+1	I was impressed by how quick the team moves to clean up.

0	If you like food.... 
+1	You need to come here!!!!
0	We love Cracker Barrel, but our waitress here needs to go, at least get a stern talking to.  
-1	I know she forgot to put our order in.  
-1	We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but waited over half an hour for our food.  
-1	The people who came right awhile after us got their food right after we got ours. 
-1	AND she wrote "over medium" when we both ordered "over hard." 
0	Time was important because we're traveling 500 or so miles today.
0	Food was fine. 
-1	Service was slow.  
-1	She didn't clear the plates when we were done. 
-1	I'm glad there is more than just this store locally.

+1	Sandra, the waitress, was a gem and Peggy, the hostess, was so kind and nice.

+1	Couldn't want better. 
+1	Even picked up a nice winter cape on sale in the gifts department. 
+1	Whooppee!
+1	Always a great place to eat. 
+1	Nothing fancy but good basic breakfast foods. 
+1	I really enjoy the eggs in a hole. 
+1	And they have a good sweet tea. 
0	Easy growler and howler fills off I65 - less than 10 min detour.  
0	Inside a pizza parlor.  
+1	Smelled good.  
+1	Good service.  
+1	Easy parking. 
+1	This place is perfect.  
+1	Good beer.  
+1	Good food.  
+1	Excellent staff.  
+1	It is small, which adds to the appeal.  
+1	Nice outdoor seating for the warm months. 
+1	One of my favorites in NWI.  
+1	Quiet lounge area with lots of room.  
+1	Beers are delicious and so is the pizza.  
+1	Sunday you get a XL for the price of a large pizza.  
+1	Nice place and I will be going back! 
+1	Great beers, mediocre service, pretty good food.

0	Food is okay. 
+1	Still a five star.
-1	We walked in to Dave and Busters October 20th for lunch and was thinking the lady in front of us was wearing way to much perfume, so bad that my eyes started to burn and tear up when she walked away the smell was still there we decided it was an air freshener and I ask one of the people working was this smell through out the entire restaurant and he replied yes it was. 
-1	We lost our appetite at that point from the smell and left.  
0	I have never been in a restaurant that smothered there food aromas from the kitchen with perfumed air fresheners. 
0	The aromas from he kitchen actually enhances the taste buds and makes people hungry therefore increasing your sale potential from orders. 
-1	Bad idea from the manager at this site. 
-1	After we recovered from our nausea and burning sensation to our nostrils  we to Cheddars and had a wonderful lunch.
+1	We just went here for the first time and it was absolutely phenomenal. 
+1	The food was so delicious and our waitress was super cool. 
+1	Not to mention after we got done eating our delicious food we got to go right over and play games. 
+1	Great experience. 
+1	Can't wait to go back.
-1	Games are all that this location has going for it. 
-1	The food is terrible and overpriced for the quality served. 
-1	Short staffed waited 20 min for drinks the waitress was rushing talking so fast we didn't know what she said. 
-1	We have been to many Dave and Busters on the east coast but this location is a joke.
+1	First time going here with my family it was awesome our server was the best we spent about $200-250 a little pricey but it was worth it, definitely beats chuckee  cheese ? 
+1	will come back soon!
+1	I celebrated a birthday here and everyone had a great time!  
+1	We got the Eat and Play combos and our server was excellent!  
+1	All of the arcades were working and the prizes were affordable, had a fun time!
+1	My wife and I have eaten here a few times.... 
+1	The food has always been good, well-cooked and promptly delivered to our table.  
-1	Refill service and table seating can be slow with no apparent relationship to how busy or staffed they are.  
-1	If they could work on their service/staffing issues this would be a first rate Dennys.
0	Driving cross-country, we were tired of fast food and waited to find a Denny's, looking forward to sitting down and to the usual good service.  
-1	However, while the food was typical good Denny's food (when we finally got it), the service at this Denny's was the worst we've ever experienced, virtually nonexistent.  
-1	Upon entering the restaurant we stood at the front desk for five minutes, totally ignored, and saw only one waitress running around handling everything in the restaurant.  
-1	We saw no other staff.  
0	Finally a hostess (manager?) 
0	came out from the back to deliver a check to a table.  
-1	She made eye contact with us ... and then headed toward the back again, ignoring us.  
-1	We waved our arms and she came over.  
-1	We were shown a booth ... and then proceeded to sit ignored for twenty more minutes.  
-1	By that time several other staff members had appeared, mostly walking in and out from the back and standing around talking while that one waitress continued to do most of the work.  
-1	We couldn't tell who was supposed to be doing what because when the other staff members did do anything, there didn't seem to be any clear division of labor: at different times different people seated customers, bussed tables, rang up checks, etc. -- all while ignoring us.  
0	We were on the verge of walking out in disgust when finally we caught the waitress' eye and waved her over.  
-1  We felt bad for her because she seemed to be swamped and stressed.
+1  Excellent! 
-1 I admit I went in expecting a long wait given how busy they were and slow to seat people. 
+1   However they handled it well! 
+1  Didn't take long to get my food once seated. 
+1  Plus it was cooked to perfection and exactly how I ordered it. 
+1  Great Denny's! 
+1  This place has greatly improved. 
+1  The manager Ashly is a wonderful loving person and I personally was blessed to spend some time and chat with her. 
+1  She strives to satisfy her patrons and provide a friendly atmosphere with quality food and service.
0   I work a dedicated route here and usually eat breakfast here 3 to 4 times a week.
0   I'm here quite a bit. 
-1  Service is very very very below poor. 
-1  Sorry ladies you ain't getting no tip from me. 
-1  The only way I even come here is to sit and visit with friends. 
-1  I thought maybe after the remodel it might get better, but no. 
-1  Service is beyond poor. 
-1  It's obvious the management don't care it all bleeds down from the top.. 
-1  I do apologise for a crappy review, but it is what it is..Ordered pizza for our late night cravings on the Dominos app. 
+1  Super freaking easy to use. 
+1  I made special instructions to not ring the doorbell because I've got kids sleeping, and the delivery guy, Matthew, was awesome enough to call us when he was coming up the street to make sure he didn't wake the kids. 
+1  Freaking awesome. 
+1  Chatted with him about his night, and he's honestly the nicest delivery guy my friend and I have ever met. 
+1  His wife and kids should be proud
+1  Good job Matthew . 
+1  OH AND THE PIZZA IS GREAT ?
0   We use the app to order almost weekly. 
+1  Love it and love Dominos!  
+1  Quality has improved and the prices can't be beat.
+1  Michael the delivery guy is cute af and it made my day. 
+1  Thank you very muchOrdered from here 5 or 6 times and it has always been good. 
+1  Your not going to get a $20+ pizza for $8 but you will get a very good $8 pizza.
-1  So far, my boy ceaser that's supposed to be delivering this pizza and garlic knots isn't here from a 2.2 mile destination after like 20 minutes of saying he was on the way. 
-1  Wth Ceaser, we really counted on you. ** UPDATE** so freaking Ceaser just cancelled our dang order. 
0  Dang Ceaser. 
-1  We are so disappointed. 
-1  And to think I almost had faith and gave you three stars.
+1  The hotel staff was very friendly. 
-1  No complimentary breakfast.  
+1  The breakfast buffet was delicious and you get quite a bit for $11.99. 
+1  They also give free warm and soft cookies..... on another note, they hold $50 per night. 
-1  We kept seeing little brown ants in our room on the wall.  
-1  I thought the price was too high due to not having a microwave or refrigerator in the room. 
0   The Evian bottle of water in the room is $4, so drink up if you want. 
+1  Pillows are extremely soft. 
0   They do offer cots. 
0   Must wear wristband to get in pool.
+1  The room was amazing and closer to the highway than we expected. 
+1  Staff and associates were helpful with directions and hospitality. 
+1  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. 
-1  Wish they had a microwave in room to re-warm cookies. 
+1  But other than that, amazing stay!!!!
+1  Hotel stay was comfortable. 
-1  NOT at all happy with transportation from airport. 
-1  Returned flight,, called hotel at 7:45 pm for "shuttles on the hour" only to find that it was going to be 50 minutes. 
0   Then I was asked if I was going to wait for it. 
0   I replied, what choice do I have, my car is in your parking lot. 
0   To which I was told that I could take a taxi. 
-1  So, I spent another 40$ on a cab ride. 
-1  Should be called park and get stranded.  
-1  WORST park and fly experience ever. 
-1  Stick to hotels because the transportation end sucks.
+1  The on site restaurant was cozy even though they had a wedding going on. 
0   We sat in the bar. 
+1  Service was slow that night, but the food was very good and worth the wait. 
0   We had the taco salad with chicken. 
+1  All of us like it as an appetizer, then burgers. 
+1  Definitely a nice time. 
+1  I would go again.
+1  My son's Wedding was held here...beautiful ceremony and beautiful room for the reception. .food was exceptional as was the wait help. ..I will look to hold any occasion at the Double Tree..
+1  I know they will give me excellent service.
+1  Who can beat Dairy Queen ice cream. 
+1  Love their hot fudge. 
+1  Had a molten lava cake That was very good. 
+1  Clean location The staff knows me. 
+1  I would be embarrassed  (I eat a LOT of blizzards), but I almost find it endearing. 
0   They also tend to get really excited when I pull up with my dogs, and they give us pup cups.
+1  Fresh and fast. 
+1  Can really tell a good  difference in the food since a couple years ago.
+1  Great food quality and it took about 2 minutes for our group of 5 people to receive our food. 
+1  Great visit overall.
+1  This DQ has always been great as far as i remember. 
+1  I have always had great service and they seats are always clean. 
+1  I love the outside seating. 
0   My favorite meal is the chicken fingers 5 buck lunch with the upgrade to a blizzard. 
0   I've been here a couple of times. 
-1  The music is always loud but the second time it was just too loud. 
-1  Not a fan of that. 
+1  Ordered the sweet potato fries and the regular fries, both were great with a nice mayo dip. 
-1  Would have liked more dip as there were lots of fries. 
0   Will update review once I actually eat something there. 
+1  This place was great. 
+1  Just a nice casual neighborhood bath with good prices and specials. 
+1  Ben the bartender was great to meet and talk to. 
+1  They had a pretty great playlist playing (lots of indie rock) before the dj showed up, who switched to remixes of top 40 as the crowd shifted. 
-1  Would have preferred the indie rock but not a big deal, later night crowd probably doesn't. 
+1  All in all though I had a great experience here.  
+1  Cheap, tasty food and drinks via friendly and attentive service. 
0   Just a bar. 
0   Nothing more, nothing less. 
+1  With Three Aces gone, this could be one of the better ones on Taylor Street. 
+1  Pretty random crowd when I was there (early-mid evening) - some old regulars, some super young college kids, which is pretty cool. 
0   On the other hand, there was a DJ setting up at around 11 when I was heading out, so it likely flips heavy college crowd late night. 
+1  Love the food and service, everyone is always so friendly! 
+1  The food is amazing here.  
+1  If you want really good homemade Cole slaw, then this is the place you're looking for.  
+1  I had the grilled pork tenderloin sandwich (aka the Naked Pygmy) and my husband had the smoked chicken breast sandwich (sorry, don't remember the name of it) and both were amazing!  
+1  Also, the bartender is very friendly - even to newbies like us!  
+1  Come and enjoy an afternoon or evening out here!  
+1  You'll enjoy it! 
+1  Love it! 
+1  Awesome food and Awesome service! 
+1  It doesn't look like much on the outside but the ambiance on the inside is awesome. 
+1  A lot of items are smoked..tasty. 
+1  Definitely a place you can kick back and relax.  
+1  The help are friendly and don't rush you. 
0   At one time this was a bank and you can go into what was once the vault. 
0   EVERY entre features smoked meat. 
-1  Smoked meat is NOT a favorite of mine, though it was ok here,  I"d have preferred something NOT smoked! 
0   I was with other people and had no choice of dining. 
-1  Please offer something for those of us who don't like smoked meat! 
+1  Amazing food , good atmosphere .....Always a good drink and or food special.  
+1  Bartenders Rock !
0   Went for a private event. 
-1  Worst mixed drinks I've ever had. 
-1  Bartenders were rude.
-1  The service and management what a joke. 
-1  The server we had took for ever to come to our table that we had to order our drinks at the bar. 
-1  Then when we told the gerneral manager what had happened didn't care nor did he wanna compensate for what we had to go thru. 
-1  I was like wow this is a joke right and he said no next time go somewhere else
+1  Great staff great menu and drink specials every night. 
+1  Friendly atmosphere and fun crowd
0   Went for brunch. 
-1  The deal is AMAZING for drinks, but the food is mediocre at best.
0   No frills sports bar with a casual vibe. 
0   Came here for the p popular Sunday brunch which includes unlimited Mimosas and beer and includes an unlimited brunch buffet. 
+1  The food ok, nothing to mouth-watering but for 25 bucks, it's definitely worth it. 
+1  If gets packed and loud during the time which gives it a lively feel. 
+1  Great service by the waitress and food was good.  
+1  Drinks were decent.  
-1  The bouncers though are basically giant idiots pumped up on steroids.  
-1  While violently removing a patron one of these grunts knocked into me.  
-1  I was on crutches so it's fairly easy to lose my balance and landed into one of their slot machines.  
-1  No apologies given and landed on my broken foot.  
-1  I will never return because of their desire to use violence over diplomacy.
+1  Ordered delivery and got a fresh hot pizza within half the time of my expected delivery. 
+1  Best pizza I've had in a while!
+1  Yes this place is a local dive bar but service here is always above amazing. 
+1  Everyone is so friendly, plus the place is clean and they have a great outside patio. 
+1  Pizza is pretty good also. 
+1  Another great plus is that you cannot beat the drink prices. 
+1  I would definitely recommend this.
+1  Great place to hangout with friends. 
+1  The food is perfect and the service is outstanding.
+1  Food was Great. 
+1  Drink was Delicious. 
+1  Service was Awesome.
-1  Entrance foyer gets crowded during lunch people are trying to pay as others are trying to get seated from the same girl. 
-1  They should push the seating 4 feet back and the entrance would be more welcoming. 
0   I ordered a chicken breast  dish which was a butterflied to ensure it is cooked thoroughly. 
-1  The texture was rubber and I could tell it was the solution injected type. 
0   Salt water solution.  
-1  Waiter could barely communicate in English and was pushy to get my order. 
-1  This was my first and last visit.
+1  The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the room itself is fantastic. 
+1  The high ceilings make it feel so much larger. 
+1  The food was delicious and there are several options for any type of eater. 
-1   The lay out when you first walk in is cramped if the restaurant is busy, but manageable. 
+1  The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. 
+1  I would recommend stopping in!
0   Having grown up in Southern California, I was used to excellent, authentic Mexican food. 
0   I've lived in the Midwest for 20 years and eaten at doses of restaurants. 
+1  This is the only Mexican restaurant that meets my high standards. 
+1  I love the food and the team at El Mexicano!
+1  I love to eat and it is very hard to fill me up and this place did it in  one plate!! 
+1  I highly recommend this place if you want your money's worth.
+1  A little out of the way, but worth the drive.
+1  Really a nice place to visit. 
+1  The waiter who served us had very good knowledge about everything in the menu. 
+1  Everything was nice and tidy. 
+1  Food was delicious, especially the british beer was amazing! 
+1  Definitely a go go!
+1  Usually have several really good beers on tap.  
+1  From what I recall they also have a decent scotch selection.   
+1  Its got a nice interesting atmosphere as well.
+1  One of the better and cheaper casual dining restaurants in the loop. 
+1  It's not haute cuisine, but there are a variety of British and American themed comfort foods available with a little something for everybody. 
+1  Good appetizers, soup and salad variety in addition to main courses, all good food at good value. 
+1  A great stop when you're travel-weary and need a warm meal late in the evening.
+1  The food was good, if not a bit over priced for the quality.  
0   Standard British menu items.  
0   The beer selection was adequate but not outstanding.  
-1  They had all of the standard beers to be sure, but their "craft selection was limited to the standard stuff.  
0   I didn't notice and unique beers from the UK.
-1  Went for breakfast service was good, typical breakfast, though the banger tasted as if they spilled a jar of pepper in it.  
0   Pricing is about average for the city ( higher than normal for everywhere else)
-1  HORRIBLE. 
-1  Soooo disappointed. 
0   Had been coming here every so often and did at the time enjoy the food. 
0   WOW ! 
-1  Has it ever changed and not for the good.  
-1  I took my daughter their for dinner and the quality of the food was terrible. 
-1  The perch was soggy, the rice was overcooked as were the beans. 
-1  They she had a dead FLY in her soup. 
0   When we showed the waiter he had this shocked look on his face. 
-1  He took it and walked away and didn't come back for like 10 minutes, laid down the check and said thank you. !!!!! 
0   WHAT!!!  
-1  No manager, No, I'm sorry,  No discount, Didn't even ask how our food was or if we wanted dessert. 
-1  Will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN !!!!!
0   This is an attempt to bring casual dining mixed with fine dining atmosphere. 
-1  Casual dress is ok, you will pay fine dining prices and not as good food.
-1  We were pretty bummed. 
-1  The menu didn't match what was online either. 
+1  Good service though. 
-1  Save your money go to another place.
+1  We could not have had a more pleasant brunch. 
+1  The staff was amazing. 
+1  The buffet was great. 
+1  The staff constantly prepared fresh food for the buffet. 
+1  My friend, myself, and our kids loved this place. 
+1  We had terrible experice at jellys the weekend prior, so Fahrenheit two twelve definitely restored our confidence in visiting local restaurants. 
+1  Thanks to staff for our awesome experience!!
+1  Amazing food and amazing service! 
+1  Best Lake perch and prime rib we've ever had. 
+1  Reasonable prices and nice atmosphere as well.
+1  I love this place! 
+1  The food is great! 
+1  I had a very attentive and sweet Waitress!  
+1  We had the perch and it was delicious!
+1  The best tasting BBQ ribs I have ever had. 
0   We always order naked ribs. 
+1  The chicken was also very good. 
+1  The sides were tasty. 
-1  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the service. 
-1  One of us is diabetic and we asked for some crackers before we got the meal...and you guessed right ... we did not get until it was pointed out. 
-1  Only bad part of our visit was that we were waiting at the hostess stand for a couple of minutes before someone helped us. 
0   Our food was also apparently slow to be served, because they gave us $5 off and free dessert. 
0   Not that we had noticed or were in a hurry to  eat, but we didn't argue. 
+1  Food itself was great; basic BBQ menu but well prepared. 
+1  I had the spare ribs, excellent; my wife had the cedar plank salmon, good; my son had the beef tips, good. 
+1  Free dessert was the bread pudding, incredible. 
-1  Be warned: just reading the calorie counts on the menu is enough to give you a heart attack.
+1  I will say the food was amazing!! 
-1  The only reason why I'm eating it so low was our server. 
-1  Between her comments about her baby, ignoring us, and making comments about how she didn't want to be there I don't know what was worse. 
-1  When we first got there she said how she wouldn't eat anything on the menu because her baby wasn't feeling it.  
-1  We had to ask the host on 2 occasions to please get us refills. 
-1  What was the worst is we waited for 10 minutes to get our check and it was like there was no one in the whole restaurant. 
-1  When our server came back she made a comment that she was cleaning in the back so she didn't notice that we were done. 
-1  The food was amazong but a bad server ruined our experience. 
+1  We may try this place again due to the amazing food and the bang for your buck. 
-1  The server we had definitely needs more trainning.
+1  I've come to this place several times and it has always had a very chill atmosphere. 
+1  Friendly staff and good food.
+1  I'm definitely gonna keep making the drive to the one on L street because of the customer service. 
-1  We ordered a platter and was told they were gonna call when it was ready to pick up and never got a call. 
-1  After that I had a coupon for buy one get one half off entree and they wouldnt do anything even though the one on L has done multiple times, Lets keep in mind the platter is about 6 entree. 
0   Ill keep going to L street one.
-1  DO NOT EAT HERE! 
-1  I took my husband here for his birthday and it was not a great experience. 
+1  Yes, we were seated right away. 
+1  The decor and modern feel makes this place look like it has potential to knock your party out of this world, but that's the best part. 
-1  It took 20 minutes for our table to be waited on and we were the only group in the place. 
-1  We ordered our food and waited from 45-60 minutes before food was served. 
-1  When the food came, some of it was cold others over cooked. 
-1  Everyone was upset. 
-1  They attempted to provide us Champagne for a toast, but the champagne tasted bad as well. 
-1  Most of the glasses we left completely full on the table. 
-1  Overall, it was a bad experience. 
-1  DO NOT GO HERE.
0   Mob Mentality was at Filini!  
+1  Great staff.  
+1  Great drinks.  
-1  Today we had a horrible experience at Filini.  
+1  We were seated right away (which is the best part of the story), the waitress took our order which consisted of an appetizer and two lunch entrees.  
-1  We waited eternally for the appetizer, which we had to ask a busboy to get for us.  
-1  Then one entree came out alone, so we complained.  
0   The waitress said  "so sorry our kitchen is backed up."  
-1  About 20 minutes later my pasta came out, all limp and overcooked.  
-1  They did comp the entire meal, but what a horrible lunch.  
-1  One family of 4 sat for 45 minutes without even a single waiter/waitress stopping by.  
-1  If I could give it zero stars I would.
+1  Amazing experience and food! 
+1  Highly recommend!
+1  The pizza was excellent--most likely because of the amazing oven they have on full display in the bar. 
-1  Service was mediocre and somewhat on the slow side. 
-1  The burgers were passably adequate but definitely did not live up to the expectations from the description and price. 
0   It was my first time there.  
0   Birthday dinner for a long time friend. 
+1  Dinner was good. 
0   But like I stated, it was a birthday dinner. 
0   My friend told the waitress it was her birthday when she first came over. 
0   A little while later the waitresses acknowledged another patron's birthday with a candle lit dessert and a song. 
0   My friend however never had this experience. 
0   Her Birthday gift bag & card were in plain sight the entire time we were there.
+1  Great food and atmosphere!! 
+1  The staff all worked well together between seating customers,  taking and delivering orders promptly and clearing tables for those who were waiting. 
+1  There is a private room for those who  have larger parties or have a private event. 
+1  Personally tried the Mac n Cheese Bacon Burger....fanominal!! 
0   For Dessert... 
+1  BlackBerry Cobbler w/ Vanilla ice cream...delicious! 
+1  Will be returning for another wonderful dining experience.
0   I've known of this place since high school but didn't start my patronage until about 2 years ago. 
+1  The bartenders are always friendly, I never have trouble with parking and the house beer rotation had much variety. 
+1  Their fruit wheat beer is seasonal and super tasty (we had blueberry tonight). 
+1  And the food had never disappointed my palate.
+1  Words can not express how Grateful and My Love for the Services provided here. 
+1  I always will Highly Recommend this place to everyone.
+1  Thank you, so much for all the Awesome service here and the Staff is very professional and Polite.
+1  The place is Clean and I feel very much comfortable and at home here. ??????
-1  Skip the ribs and brisket, stick to the burgers, etc. 
-1  Ribs and brisket were dry, definitely needed the BBQ sauce. 
+1  House beers are good though. 
+1  Had 2 different IPAs, and the Hefeweizen, very tasty. 
+1  Francesca's is consistently great and, while not cheap, it's generally reasonably priced. 
+1  The staff are friendly and efficient. 
+1  The food is great. 
+1  The atmosphere is very pleasant.  
+1  There are other Francesca's locations and in my experience they aren't nearly as good, but Francesca's on Taylor has been a consistent winner for me for years. 
+1  Great service and delicious food. 
+1  The chef will make a special dish for you if you want something special that not on the menu.  
+1  Staff is always extremely courteous.  
+1  Environment is wonderful.  
+1  The pizza was fantastic! 
+1  It was nice speaking Italian with someone who was right from the same area as my Great-grandparents! 
+1  Excellent service too! 
+1  Great pasta. 
+1  Bread with very high quality olive oil and parmesan with every meal. 
0   Held a work lunch meeting there in a private space. 
+1  Great food, service, and value. 
0   My group (6 total) was looking for a place close to us that would be laid back and not too pricey. 
-1  The food was fine, a little over cooked, but our waiter was terrible. 
-1  He never checked on us, and when we went up to him to ask for sauce, we had to wait as he slowly poured drinks and watched tv. 
-1  There were maybe 2 or 3 other couples in the establishment, so his attention shouldn't have been an issue. 
-1  When we finally got a check, he never offered to split it (probably so he could add on gratuity because he knew he was terrible). 
-1  When we asked him to split it, he told us to flip the check around and write out what our orders were because there was "no way" he would remember what we got. 
-1  So we had to write out and tally up our checks, and he still had the audacity to add the 18% gratuity to the individual checks. 
-1  I only gave it 2 stars because the guy helping him was nice overall. 
-1  I would not recommend though, and will never go back. 
-1  There are plenty of other places to eat in Chicago, it's no wonder nobody was there on a Friday night. 
0   We stopped in to get out of the rain and have a drink. 
+1  Service was good considering how busy it was at the time. 
+1  Good selection of beers - they claim to have over 100 available. 
+1  I particularly liked how many local brews they had. 
+1  Didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that, but what I saw looked good. 
-1  The only thing keeping me from a 5-star review is that there were only 10 beers on tap. 
-1  Selection was pretty good, but I'd think a place like that should have at least a couple dozen. 
+1  Good experience overall - I'd recommend it. 
0   Stopped in for a bit to let my dog rest while we walked around the city. 
+1  They were so friendly. 
+1  They brought out a dog bowl and a treat for my buddy to snack on while I enjoyed a beer! 
+1  Great beer selection. 
+1  Really friendly staff. 
+1  I will definitely be back again! 
0   Standard Chicago style modern bar with high top seating.  
-1  The food is rather standard and a bit duplicated from other similar bars.  
+1  Still a decent place to grab a bite to eat in the south loop. 
+1  Good bar food. 
+1  They have great mac and cheese. 
+1  Service is always good and fast.
+1  Excellent! 
0   That word describes everything you�ll experience here. 
+1  Food was superb, bartender made the drinks fast and they were unique to the restaurant, server knew what to recommend by asking a few questions and speed was on point for each order. 
0   First time here in Chicago and have been a fan of his show so decided to try it. 
+1  I love Mexican food and each dish was spectacular to the last bite. 
+1  I just wish I had a bigger appetite.
+1  Wonderful! 
0   My business mentor and I dined here. 
0   It was my thank you dinner for her asking me to join her for a conference in Chicago.
0   Come to find out she was a foodie like me! 
+1  We appreciated each bite. 
0   This is not a place for just a meal. 
+1  This restaurant is for those who appreciate food, the mouth feels, the flavor profiles, and the back stories. 
+1  This restaurant - and those like it - are for the 'fans'. 
+1  It's like buying an album of a music artist then seeing them in concert with front row tickets. 
+1  It's like being into art and going to The Picasso exhibit when it comes to town.
+1  Quite possibly the best Mexican food I've ever had. 
+1  We got the tortilla soup, holy smokes. 
+1  Then these little tamale boats with carnitas inside, insane. 
0   Shared the Thursday special of flank steak and made tacos out of it... 
+1  To die for.
+1  Best Mexican food made in America. 
+1  I have never been disappointed no matter what I had off the menu. 
+1  This place is great for lunch if you have time to spare.
0   Second visit. 
+1  The food and service were very good. 
+1  I think the  River North taxes make some of the simple dishes a bit much, but in all, very delicious.
+1  I loved it! 
+1  Everything was delicious! 
+1  The service was great! 
+1  Never heard of it before the party,  but I would definitely recommend it!
+1  Had the filet mignon, very tasty.  
-1  Not very impressed with the attitude of the servers or knowledge of bartender.  
0   A solid 3 on my scale for overall opinion of the restaurant.
+1  Superb Northern Italian Cuisine. 
+1  Attentive wait staff. 
+1  Elegant surroundings for both dining and parties.
+1  Best place in NWI by far. 
+1  You feel like you are part of the family in Italy.
+1  Great restaurant, with excellent food and great service! 
+1  Fantastic popcorn. 
+1  Got the one with caramel and cashews which was delicious. 
+1  Reasonably priced as well, about $5 for a bag of popcorn. 
0   They seems to be a bit busier than others I have been to.  
0   While that means a little extra wait at times it also means fresh popcorn. 
+1  The staff I have had is always very pleasant and the service is quick.  
0   Standard example of a Garrett's.  
+1  Popcorn is fresh.   
0   Why I'd go here vs. the ones on Michigan Ave?  
+1  NO LINES.  
0   EVER. 
-1  Good popcorn but way over priced. 
+1  I got the mixed which was really good. 
+1  Chicago just isn't Chicago without a visit to Garrett's! 
+1  Love the cheese popcorn but you will need the moist towelettes you will find in the bottom of your bag!
+1  I love this place. 
+1  The food is awesome and the staff is great. 
+1  This restaurant would be my 1st choice to recommend for Italian food.
+1  Try the deep dish pizza--you won't regret it! 
+1  I'm sure a purist will say it's not as good as the ones in Chicago, and they may be right, but it's still the best pizza I've had in Macomb.
+1  Great food, good price, and EXCELLENT service... 
+1  Highly recommend!!
+1  Loved my lunch with my guy.... great guy serving us too!!
+1  Loved the lunch pizza buffet and great service!
+1  The food and ambience have always been outstanding.  
+1  The general manager, Riley, she went above and beyond to make our experience great.  
+1  She went out of her way and made a not so good situation into one that will bring us back multiple times over.  
+1  Can't wait to eat here again!
+1  One of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. 
+1  The tartare, bone marrow, and mussels are enough to travel back to Chicago for. 
+1  Don't skip the cocktails - they're perfect. 
+1  I definitely recommend this place, just ensure you get there early to avoid a wait!
-1  Really the only down side was the main course portions are a bit less than what I expected. 
+1  The pot roast was excellent, but the menu said it came with root vegetables. 
0   Root vegetables consisted of maybe 4 or 5 bits size chunks of carrots and 6 whole mini onions. 
+1  The pot roast just fell apart so easy, tender and delicious with a great sauce! 
+1  Beef tartare was excellent, black Manhattan cocktail was perfect.
+1  meatball appetizer was good, carrot cake was good but not phenomenal.
+1  Couldn't ask for anything more regarding service.
+1  Many reasons that I love this place... 
+1  I usually travel to Chicago alone but always manage to find a bar spot here, my longest wait for someone to get up was about 5 min, even on a busy weekend night. 
+1  Bartenders are pros and do justice to classics, Martinis, Manhattans, Cosmo, whatever. 
+1  Food is always outstanding, although a la carte is not my favorite... 
-1  It's not about cost, I'd just rather leave pairing of sides to the professionals. 
-1  I wish they'd correct that. 
+1  But the attraction is the ambiance... dark, hip, cool, and even a bit romantic making me regret traveling alone. 
+1  So many great restaurants in Chicago but Gilt is always a must for me. 
+1  Always leave wanting to tell someone about it, so... there you have it.
+1  Riley the GM is amazing. 
+1  She turned our �not so good� situation into a five star rating. 
+1  Thank you again!
+1  This spot will hit your pizza spot! 
-1  Deep dish Pizza takes about 45 minutes to cook and sometimes there's a long wait depending on the day and time. 
0   Call first.
+1  Solid Pizza and the atmosphere is really unique. 
+1  This spot is pretty legendary and is definitely a crowd favorite. 
+1  If you go to Chicago I definitely recommend checking it out. 
+1  You won't be disappointed.
-1  The parking is really limited due to it being in the city, but they do offer $17 valet service. 
0   So why not.
+1  Amazing food (not sure how they made such great hummus for a pizza place). 
+1  Pizza obviously awesome. 
+1  Great wines. 
+1  All were friendly other than the host who didn't like that we asked to sit in the other section.
0   My daughter and I got a Lg sausage & pepperoni deep dish. 
-1  It tasted good but was served way too hot - our hands got burned from scalding hot grease. 
-1  The server never voluntarily refilled our drinks and rarely even came around after we ordered. 
-1  Our drinks went dry FOUR times - unsat! 
-1  3 of those times we had to ask other employees for refills. 
-1  Did not feel the love.
+1  Went there with a large group and we're very accommodated. 
+1  A bit pricey - and the deep dish takes about 45 minutes to cook, but the staff was smart, kind, and pro-active in the way they prepared you for the experience.
+1  It was super tasty, deep dish was good and the hand tossed was also tasty.  
+1  Bread sticks were nothing special but good.
+1  The serving staff was above average - and promptly kept us all full of waters without getting snarky about ALL the water we were drinking.  
0   We'd been walking a ton from the navy pier.
+1  Highly recommend!
0   We enjoy Chicago deep dish pizza so we stopped in here. 
+1  Fun place with  grafitti everywhere. 
+1  Pizza did not disappoint! 
0   (Wasn't our first time eating Gino's.) 
+1  Great server, too, for a busy night, he stayed on top of everything!
0   Went there for my birthday celebration. 
+1  They were able to accommodate my party which was 15 people without any issues. 
+1  We had plenty of room. 
+1  The food was excellent, so worth the steak house price. 
0   I had the rack of lamb. 
+1  It was prepared perfectly and tasted awesome! 
+1  The service was also excellent. 
+1  Definitely recommend this place for a dinner party or a quiet dinner for two.
-1  I called to make a reservation and they told me they could not accommodate for that many people. 
0   The funniest thing is I been making a reservation there for the last three years for my company. 
-1  The manager was very rude to me and needs to go back to school on how to talk to people and learn how to run a business. 
-1  The place must be going down hill if you let anyone in there without a reservation. 
-1  And please stop serving old crab legs my wife got sick there and nothing was done.
-1  I took my boyfriend out for his birthday and we would have been happier at Wendy's. 
-1  The service was horrible. 
-1  Not only was our waitress uninformed of the specials but uncaring we were celebrating his special day! 
-1  The cocktails we ordered were either pumped up with sugar or drowning in sour lemon juice. 
-1  Our steaks we orderer were still walking/ raw when we asked for med. raw. 
-1  The potatoes were from a box with powed garlic mixed in.  
-1  We didnt stay for dessert and it wasn't even asked. 
-1  We had to wait for our food to come out then our waitress was ready to box it up in 3 minuted. 
-1  Can't believe they are still in business
+1  Never disappoints. 
0   Had appetizers. 
+1  Wait staff were awesome.
+1  Colossal Shrimp cocktail...good!   
+1  Excellent service.
+1  I have been here or ordered from here multiple times and have always had great food and service.  
-1  However, I ordered takeout last night and my stuffed pizza was not up to par.  
-1  Half of the pizza was under cooked or something and I called in about it.  
+1  The manager was super nice and offered us another pizza even though we were able to eat half and the issue may have even been caused by excess water from a poor topping choice (no more spinach for take out). 
+1  Anyway, great establishment and they really do care if you enjoyed your experience or not.
+1  One of the best dining experiences I've ever had was here. 
0   I was visiting from CA and decided to try out this place. 
+1  The service was excellent. 
+1  The waitress was so kind and helpful. 
+1  We got service you would expect at a 5 star restaurant . 
0   We had a party of forty-five, sixteen of which were very hungry soccer players. 
+1  Made reservations earlier in the week and they were very accommodating.  
+1  Had it all set up for us when we got there and the service was great even though they had another huge party right before ours. 
+1  Food was excellent. 
-1  Only reason I gave it only four stars was because it was very hot in the back where we were seated. 
-1  I know there were a lot of people but the air didn't seem to be working.
-1  Would have LOVED to have had a deep dish tonight...but after being seated in a section right away and then IGNORED for twenty minutes, we walked out. 
-1  It would have been different if the server hadnt walked into our section FIVE times to help the other customers there without even acknowledging we were there. 
-1  To make matters worse as we were pointing this out to the manager who seated us, he was so busy helping the other people waiting to be seated, all he had was a rushed 'Sorry'. 
-1  Really very dissatisfied and of course, hungry.....?
+1  Very nice. 
+1  Great beef sandwiches. 
+1  Delicious beef juice.
+1  Everything about this place was amazing. 
+1  We sat at the bar and the experience was incredible. 
+1  We had a very attentive bartender/server that explained everything to us and asked questions as we went. 
0   I�m a vegan and I thought finding options here would be difficult. 
+1  But they have set vegetarian options that can be made vegan. 
+1  Sometimes when you get the vegan alternative, it�s just bad, but all of the vegan dishes I was served did not disappoint! 
+1  Can�t wait to go back!
+1  Everything was so amazing! 
0   There were 3 of us so we got to taste a lot. 
0   We had the beets, the chickpea fritter (probably my favorite), the goat empanadas, pig face (don't pass this up just because of the name), the crispy pork shank, and the goat belly. 
+1  I recommend every single one. 
+1  The ring of fire is also an amazing drink if you like something a touch sweet and spicy. 
0   Definitely plan to make reservations a few months ahead of time if you want to come here while visiting Chicago.
+1  The food here is rich and savory, if that's what you're looking for on date night then this will be the perfect place. 
0   If instead you're looking for small plates or something lighter I would say maybe hold of for another time. 
+1  We were lucky enough to get a 10pm reservation and I was extremely impressed with the empanadas and the green beans. 
-1  Nothing we ate disappointed us but I did find myself wanting something light to balance the meal better.
0   What can I say that hasn't already been said� I don't know. 
+1  The food is fun, the atmosphere is inviting and the service was great. 
+1  Could not ask for more. 
+1  We let the waitress pick the dinner for us and not only did she have fun doing it, but she picked some great items for us to try. 
+1  I have already recommended to my friends
-1  While it was an interesting experience and great service, I didn't feel like the taste fully justified the price. 
0   For two people, the bill was $130 before tip. 
0   We each had one cocktail and ordered average priced items. 
+1  The atmosphere was upscale and fun. 
+1  The hosts and servers were friendly.
+1  Great selection of food and tons of deserts. 
-1  I wish the salad section was a bit bigger but it's adequate. 
+1  They have cooked ham sliced just for you at lunch, classic comfort food such as chicken and potroast. 
+1  Lots of great sides to pick from, and oh yeah, lots of deserts including a chocolate fondue fountain.
